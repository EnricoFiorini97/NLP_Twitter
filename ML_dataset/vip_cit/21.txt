Brimmer gave this door (14thâ€“15th c., with later additions) to the MFA in 1877, after purchasing it at the Philadelphia Centennial Exhibition in 1876. It's a pastiche of many elements, scavenged from grand mosques & tombs built under the rule of Egypt's Mamluk sultans. #mfa150pic.twitter.com/waigUOkMvE
