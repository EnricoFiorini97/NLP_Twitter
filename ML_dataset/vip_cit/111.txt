Happy birthday to Anna Atkins, born #onthisday in 1799! Trained as a botanist, Atkins developed an interest in photography as a means of recording botanical specimens for a scientific reference book, British Algae: Cyanotype Impressions. #5womenartists http://bit.ly/2pkFmgHÂ pic.twitter.com/BtcF6JYPk6
