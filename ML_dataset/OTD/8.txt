Today is the last day to see #ArtisticLicense at @Guggenheim #GuggenheimNYC - go if you can!  Absolutely loved the 6 "living masters" take on the collection. Such fantastic themes, the "great artists before they were famous" is huge fun - both abstract themes are wonderful. Wow!pic.twitter.com/jaLevEMirX
