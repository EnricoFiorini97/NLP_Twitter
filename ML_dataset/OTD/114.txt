Raphael died #onthisday in 1520. Here’s one of his ‘cartoons’ – full-size drawings made so the images could be transferred onto paintings, frescoes, textiles or stained glass. The word cartoon comes from the Italian ‘cartone’ for large piece of paper. http://ow.ly/khxe30jlLSZ pic.twitter.com/x1FYlJDzjc
