We want you to join our third annual Block Party on July 26! "Room to Move" is this year's theme and we want to know: What does movement mean to you? If you have a story, idea, or artistic practice you’d like to share, submit your pitch by February 15: http://artic.edu/blockparty pic.twitter.com/jxlCJirla8
