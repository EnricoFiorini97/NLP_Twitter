Antinous, the young lover of Emperor Hadrian, drowned in the Nile River while on an imperial tour of Egypt. Devastated by the untimely death, Hadrian founded a city in his honor, Antinoupolis, and pronounced him a god. See "Portrait Bust of Antinous as Osiris" in Ancient Art.pic.twitter.com/8AxgMUTPx9
