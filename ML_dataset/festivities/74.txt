Thank you @sckinjctn for being part of our MFA community for so many years! #mfa150https://twitter.com/sckinjctn/status/1224712631128412161 … I'm an art historian because of my many visits to and love for the MFA that started when I was 6 years old. Congratulations on this milestone, and my best wishes for many years to come.
