On Sunday, April 15, #OneBostonDay, we invite first responders & their families to visit the Museum for free by presenting a valid ID at any ticket desk. As the city comes together for a day of service & remembrance, weâ€™re proud to honor the men and women who make #BostonStrong.pic.twitter.com/O2VGSdYxiS
