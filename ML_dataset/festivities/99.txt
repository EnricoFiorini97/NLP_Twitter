During the #Nowruz celebration on March 17, stop by the Shapiro Family Courtyard to visit and view a traditional Haft Seen display, designed and organized by Farzaneh Fallah, Mostafa Masomi, and Mojgan Olia. We hope to see you there! https://www.facebook.com/events/171988326859544/permalink/179182806140096/ …pic.twitter.com/jboLQp3z3W
