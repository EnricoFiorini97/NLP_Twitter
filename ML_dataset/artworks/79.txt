This nearly 1,000-year-old Chinese sculpture expresses the compassion embodied by the Buddhist bodhisattva #Guanyin. Called Avalokitesvara in Sanskrit & known as Kannon in Japan, all of Guanyin’s names convey “the one who pays heed to the sounds—or cries—of the world.” #HeartArtpic.twitter.com/1Pj70iBvab
