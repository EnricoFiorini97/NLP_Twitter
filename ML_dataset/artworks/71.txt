We’re proud to gift this mural to the City of Boston & @marty_walsh! It was designed by @AFHBoston & completed by visitors at our 2018 #MLKDay Open House, hosted in partnership with @CitizensBank. We can’t wait for our next #MLK celebration on Jan. 21, 2019—hope to see you there!pic.twitter.com/26VUIqpgGK
