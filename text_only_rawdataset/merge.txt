Together with the project participants, Gill improvises and documents performative scenarios in which people pose wearing the masks in various parts of the village.
Gill commissions these artisans to make new masks depicting subjects that symbolically represent the flow of their daily lives—including an elephant, a wolf, and a mobile phone (pictured above).

What was your favorite part about volunteering at the Guggenheim? My favorite part was being there during installation, when the exhibitions are taken down and put up. I liked becoming part of the installation—not that I did the work! But it was always very exciting.
How does the Frank Lloyd Wright’s design inspire you? It inspires me because the first thing is it is different. Is that good or bad? You look again, it’s not only different, it’s attractive. The museum struck a new note in art presentation.
Did you attend the museum opening in 1959? I attended opening weekend. It was very crowded. There was an air of excitement. It was a new happening. Nobody had been to a museum and walked around a circle (before)!

he Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum building turns 60 today. Neither Frank Lloyd Wright, its architect, nor the man who commissioned him to design the building, Solomon R. Guggenheim, saw it finished. We look back through the archives at its construction.https://nyti.ms/2Mz6QMt
Happy Birthday @Guggenheim! Wright was compelled by what he believed the building could be, and because of his vision, how we build and live was changed forever. Now, 60 years later, we look back on this spark that kept the museum moving forward.https://franklloydwright.org/concerning-the-solomon-r-guggenheim-museum/ …

“Plant and Animal” (1956), on view in #ArtisticLicense, is being exhibited at the Guggenheim Museum for the first time. Plan your visit:https://gu.gg/2vOFDwg
The work’s connection to the invisible forms of energy is heightened by its flexibility, which allows the sculpture to respond to vibration and movement.
“Plant and Animal” suggests this connection by giving the form of the radio antenna a distinctly organic bend, reminiscent of plant stalks or insect antennae.
#WorkoftheWeek: “Plant and Animal” (1956) was inspired by radio antennae Takis saw in Calais, France. The artist was drawn not only to the structures themselves but also to the ways in which immaterial forces that shape the world were being harnessed by new technologies.pic.twitter.com/6OGOJ8oe1E

Having studied painting with Fernand Léger, Vieira da Silva adopted the restricted palette and faceted forms of the Cubists. Rather than planning out her richly textured compositions, she often began by laying down lines, and allowed the work to evolve as she progressed.
#WorkoftheWeek: “Untitled” by Maria Helena Vieira da Silva resembles an architectural construction; its fragmented, brightly colored shapes and black lines emerge from the background in a tense, grid-like formation.pic.twitter.com/jvQrhJjQSM

Following a 1986 diagnosis, #Mapplethorpe worked to safeguard his legacy by preparing for 2 retrospective exhibitions and establishing the Robert Mapplethorpe Foundation to manage his estate, support the medium of photography in institutions, and fund HIV/AIDS medical research.
Despite the artist’s weakened condition, his confident expression and firm grasp exude a characteristic sense of control and mastery of all things, even death.
Mapplethorpe died soon after, in early 1989, from AIDS-related complications. That he chose to represent himself in such a haunting manner, holding an overtly morbid symbol of death, speaks to an awareness and acceptance of his own mortality.
#MapplethorpeMondays—in this self-portrait, which would prove to be one of Mapplethorpe’s last, his gaunt face appears to float within a black void as his hand clutches a skull-topped walking cane in the picture’s foreground.pic.twitter.com/FPkpVXBWeM

Special thanks to all of our supporters for making #BasquiatDefacement possible, including @NEAarts and @KeithHaringFdn.
Enjoy the museum after-hours every Tuesday and a film series providing additional context on the cultural climate of 1980s New York City, Basquiat’s life and work, and how artists responded to police brutality. https://gu.gg/2MZtf7Y
Works by Basquiat's peers including Keith Haring, Andy Warhol, and George Condo, among others, are also on view and provide testaments to the solidarity experienced among artists at the time.
"A closer look at 'Defacement' offers an opportunity to look at Basquiat’s more intimate topography, particularly the shields and filters through which he addressed trauma and the vicissitudes of history."—Guest Curator, Chaédria LaBouvier (@chaedria)
The exhibition's starting point is the painting "The Death of Michael Stewart," informally known as "Defacement," created by Basquiat in 1983.
"Jean-Michel Basquiat may be one of the best-known contemporary artists, but it is only recently that art historical scholarship has turned its lens toward understanding the complex iconography about race and the African-diasporic culture in his work."—Director, Richard Armstrong
"Basquiat's 'Defacement': The Untold Story" opens to the public tomorrow, June 21. The exhibition explores an early chapter in Jean-Michel Basquiat’s art that continues to resonate today in its potent exploration of social justice. #BasquiatDefacement https://gu.gg/2Lu5qke pic.twitter.com/mwZn6rGO9s

#Mapplethorpe is widely known for daring imagery that deliberately transgresses social mores, and for the censorship debates that transpired around his work in the U.S. during the late 1980s and early 1990s.

Just here for the GIFs? Watch more printmaking techniques unfold: http://met.org/2GUM2Ow pic.twitter.com/VDug66yCni
Step 8: Ta-da! You've got an etched print! But did you notice it's backwards? Once printed, the #etching's design appears in reverse of the original.  The print includes not just the design, but also the outline of the outer edges of the plate, which is known as a plate mark.pic.twitter.com/HTjGaoqojt
Step 7: Press, roll, and print  With the ink side up, the plate is placed on the bed of a rolling printing press, then covered with a sheet of dampened paper and printing blankets (often made of felt) to soften the pressure on the plate. #etchingpic.twitter.com/TQ6bN8G9Vh
Step 6: Ink away! Using a cloth ball, cardboard tab, or like material, printmakers spread ink on the plate, then remove the excess. It gets a final wipe with a tarlatan rag—a starched cheesecloth.  Sometimes artists won't wipe fully—a thin layer of ink creates tone. #etchingpic.twitter.com/VXrCRfOV1p
Step 5: Say bye-bye to the ground  Once the plate has been satisfactorily bitten by the acid (the best verb for acid!!), the printmaker removes the ground with a solvent. Ah, nice and fresh and ready for ink.  #etchingpic.twitter.com/bsP68O4yiM
Step 4: Time for acid—and gloves!  When the design is done, it's dipped in acid, which eats into the metal in the exposed areas, creating recesses that can hold ink.  More time in acid means deeper recesses that can hold more ink, resulting in darker lines on paper. #etchingpic.twitter.com/gGUDxQE9Po
Step 3: Let's get creative!  Using a blunt stylus called an #etching needle, the printmaker gently scratches away parts of the ground to create a design, exposing the metal beneath.pic.twitter.com/wwTzB6CZmH
Step 2: Prepare the plate!  To start, printmakers polish the plate to remove all scratches and imperfections from the surface.  When the surface is totally smooth, it's covered evenly with a layer of acid-resistant varnish or wax, which is called the ground.  #etchingpic.twitter.com/KdkV9brSB7
How exactly do you produce an #etching?  Enjoy this jolly fun thread to see the process unfold. Step 1: Ready your materials!  Etching is a process in which lines or areas are incised using acid into a metal plate (made of iron, copper, or zinc) in order to hold the ink.pic.twitter.com/XiuTffRsRX

7/ Want to learn more? Visit http://met.org/AlienProperty  to see photos and documents, listen to audio from #RayyaneTabet in English and Arabic, and read more about the history of the stone reliefs. #AlienPropertypic.twitter.com/r68WQBApq9
6/ Presented in collaboration between our Ancient Near Eastern and Modern & Contemporary Departments, “Rayyane Tabet / Alien Property” reminds us of the unending connections between past and present—and that every object has many stories to tell. #AlienPropertypic.twitter.com/gRK8N4HD0z
5/ In “Rayyane Tabet / Alien Property,” explore the circuitous journey of these ancient stone slabs alongside the personal story and artwork of contemporary artist Rayyane Tabet, whose charcoal rubbings of 32 of the existing reliefs are on view. #AlienPropertypic.twitter.com/PME6Z0uISN
4/ But this is only where our story begins.  In 2016 Lebanese artist #RayyaneTabet visited The Met requesting to produce rubbings of the reliefs, sharing a special connection—his great-grandfather Faik Borkhoche (center) worked at the excavation with von Oppenheim a century ago.pic.twitter.com/SIkFuzOmvM
3/ In 1931, von Oppenheim brought eight of the reliefs to the U.S. to sell but, failing to find buyers, left them in storage in New York.  In 1943, the reliefs were seized by the U.S. Office of Alien Property Custodian and put up for auction. Four came to The Met. #AlienPropertypic.twitter.com/B3TgwVkCpE
2/ In 1911 German diplomat Baron Max von Oppenheim unearthed 194 orthostats— stone slabs carved in low relief—during excavations at Tell Halaf. Over the last century, some were destroyed, lost, or stolen. Other are in museums around the world—including The Met. #AlienPropertypic.twitter.com/BCWW1szOQ3
1/ How did four 9th-century B.C. stone reliefs end up at The Met? The story is a lot more complicated than you think. Today, we opened our new exhibition “Rayyane Tabet / Alien Property,” on view through January 18, 2021. #AlienProperty http://met.org/AlienProperty pic.twitter.com/R36UFJZzPI

BruceNauman often pushes language to the brink of abstraction. The neon “My Last Name Exaggerated Fourteen Times Vertically,” (1967), alters his name beyond recognition; the elongated letters all but disappear into a jumble of lavender lines. http://mo.ma/brucenauman pic.twitter.com/eDLZmLyi0L

Many of #BruceNauman's architectural works are claustrophobia-inducing spaces that viewers can enter. In "Double Steel Cage Piece" (1974), you traverse a very narrow passage within and around a cage while others watch — a doubly uncomfortable experience.pic.twitter.com/c3uaeEDT8B
@nytimes says our #BruceNauman retrospective deserves to be seen in full. "Even his loudest, most outsized art feels personal, sourced from extreme emotions we all feel — panic, despair, disgust, hilarity — one by one.” Read the full review at http://mo.ma/read pic.twitter.com/Mo14DqXvoB
Absence, the void, and feelings of nonexistence are recurring themes in #BruceNauman's videos of the early 1970s. Here, an actor channels the feeling of “disappearing into another substance."

ing of African narratives during the audience discussion, Casely-Hayford notes that “these aren’t just histories for Africans and people of African descent. They are all our histories.”  “We can take the official narrative over and make it our own.” #BalthazarLA
figures “stand with their Balthazarian stare and cast judgment back at us. Here painting doesn’t just describe; it seeks our engagement in building a manifesto.” We are more than involved, says Casely-Hayford, we are responsible. We have no basis for lingering superiority.
uding with another, post-Enlightenment essay in identity, Casely-Hayford concludes with Picasso’s “Demoiselles d’Avignon.” Inspired by the forms of African masks, the figures on the right of the painting have what he calls an “exotic availability.” https://www.moma.org/collection/works/79766 …
Ayuba Suleiman Diallo, William Ansah Sessarakoo was an African celebrity in Europe, whose image circulated widely. https://gty.art/35L40dA   “He traps us in a moral gaze,” says Casely-Hayford. “He denies us any sense of superiority. This is a man who demands respect.”pic.twitter.com/1a34ab3Yg2

Musa “truly was a Magi—wise, rich, noble.” When he journeyed with a vast entourage to Mecca on pilgrimage in 1324, “he gave away so much gold that the price didn’t recover for a decade.” His image continued to evoke intrigue in the minds of Europeans for centuries.
Musa, the Mali emperor, was the wealthiest man the world had ever seen. He learned that “good leadership meant compromise between expansion, trade, and the people,” says Casely-Hayford. https://gty.art/2FEDrMM pic.twitter.com/ym273lje3e

hree kings are deeply enigmatic figures, yet in these figures are "encapsulated the political geography of the medieval world." In this interconnected world, Africa was the home of wealth, stability, and intellectual innovation, says Casely-Hayford.

yFoundation developed the initiative to respond to conservators’ need to understand the full range of treatment options available—whether lining or relining a canvas, removing a lining and its adhesives, tear mending, or any other intervention.pic.twitter.com/KiznMuSgho

younger painting conservators feel unprepared to perform safe lining treatments or repair aging lining treatments. There are senior conservators with the knowledge, but few training opportunities to pass on their skills.pic.twitter.com/vmiR7DwjiV
s been 45 years since the lining moratorium, which created a ripple effect on how conservators repaired artworks. A whole generation of painting conservators now has little experience with lined or refined paintings.
ll lining jobs were bad—but many had gone wrong. From that point on, the field very cautiously explored alternative methods. The 80s marked an era of new thinking for the conservation field. Conservators embraced minimal intervention, altering works as little as possible.pic.twitter.com/cugy4enb7O
te its dangers, lining was a mainstream practice for hundreds of years. And thousands, if not tens of thousands, of paintings around the world were lined or relined up until 1974.
poorly done, linings can cause paint discoloration and burns, and can even flatten thick brushstrokes. Linings can also deteriorate over time, causing more damage to the painting than if there’d been no lining at all.pic.twitter.com/Hr0dwvHCEu
ay to strengthen canvas paintings is “lining,” which involves gluing a second canvas onto the back of a painting with the use of wax-resin and a hot iron. However, today’s conservators consider lining to be an invasive and risky procedure.pic.twitter.com/Sn95RXtOKv

500 years ago, artists discovered the benefits of painting on canvas over a wood panel.

uding with another painting by Jean-Léon Gérôme (again with Vitellius), @wmarybeard explains that the artist "is using an emperor to ask us to think." "And that, I suppose, is the point of this lecture: emperors are there in paintings to get us to think about them."pic.twitter.com/WVr37GIrfm
nderestimate courtly cultures' capacity for anxiety and self-reflection," says #MaryBeard. "These images point us to a monarchical culture much more engaged with problematizing the idea of monarchy than we like to think. They are part of a complicated debate about it."
hat did the rulers of the Renaissance and beyond think of these works (such as "The Triumphs of Caesar" by Andrea Mantegna, https://gty.art/32KFEj0 ) that caution against the overreaches of autocracy?  @wmarybeard has an idea.pic.twitter.com/BzhCyVebKi
life lesson from @wmarybeard: "Ladies and gentlemen, it is always worth reading the Latin if it’s there."
he plot thickens! “This is where we have to remember our Latin,” exhorts #MaryBeard.  The *captions* on prints of these glorious Titians caution us about "the terrible ills of sad power...factional fear of discord and civil plotting..."pic.twitter.com/vL6b1sLbEx
all depictions of ancient Roman emperors in modern art were subversive"—far from it, says @wmarybeard. Modern rulers liked to trace their ancestry back to ancient Rome, often spuriously. See Titian's (now-lost) paintings of emperors, which present them in a glorious light.pic.twitter.com/jyf9yPmInP
lius's inclusion in a painting was a clue to the viewer that, just as he met a bleak end, so, too, might the decadent figures around him, notes Beard. Case in point: “Romans of the Decadence” in @MuseeOrsay, https://gty.art/32NrOfR  (find Vitellius lolling at front left).
lius, a particularly decadent emperor, illuminates how ancient rulers have been represented in art as both critique and support of the modern ruler, says @wmarybeard.pic.twitter.com/NOJkJqqY1m
look at the depraved and gluttonous emperor Vitellius—no longer a household name, but once positively ubiquitous in art. @wmarybeard has even found a Vitellius in an antique shop; the clerk claimed it once belonged to Andy Warhol. (It was out of her price range, alas.)pic.twitter.com/yD2oE56B7U
n emperors have gone down in history as a pretty villainous crew," says #MaryBeard, so shouldn’t we be surprised by how prominent they’ve become in art? Looking critically at how emperors are depicted enriches our understanding of the art in which they appear, she says.pic.twitter.com/LuGn9vw0QU
range of Roman emperors [in art] is more meaningful than just background wallpaper for the posh. In fact, emperors come in staggering varieties," says @wmarybeard, getting a laugh as she shows the emperor Augustus sculpted in chocolate. (Decaying chocolate.)
esson? "We should always, when we spot a Roman emperor in a work of modern art, say: 'What the hell’s *he* doing there?', says @wmarybeard. Roman emperors do indeed appear as (and on!) wallpaper, but they also appear in art for a reason.
Jesus’s birth, Augustus consulted a pagan prophetess, the Sibyl, on whether anyone would be born more powerful than the emperor himself—and whether he should allow himself to be worshipped as a god.  (From @LACMA: https://gty.art/2m1hJvx   https://gty.art/2lVJ0Q6 )pic.twitter.com/HTUaezMl4R
ainting contrasts Roman imperial pomp and power in the background with a nativity scene (described as "gothic" by some critics) in the foreground, says #MaryBeard.  The emperor here? Augustus, leader of Rome at the time of Jesus's birth.

an Gogh wanted to depict the harsh reality of daily peasant life. . To emphasise how tough peasant life was, Van Gogh gave the peasants in the painting coarse faces and bony, working hands. #VanGoghsDailyLifepic.twitter.com/xZ6fYvl4kY
I keep on making what I can’t do yet in order to learn to be able to do it’, wrote Vincent to his friend Anthon van Rappard in 1885. #MondayMotivation. We look to Vincent for our Monday Motivation, what about you? #VanGoghsDailyLife pic.twitter.com/73MiGcrTXC
According to American magazine Time, the Dutch have mastered ‘niksen’ – the art of doing nothing. A day without plans, chilling on the couch, listening to music or watching TV.  What’s your favourite way to ‘do nothing’?  Félix Vallotton, Laziness (La paresse) (1896)pic.twitter.com/56p33ykviA
‘Old chap, I’ve had so much pleasure drawing fishermen’s heads with that sou’wester’, wrote Vincent to his brother Theo, ‘which had fish scales still stuck to it when I got it’.  #VanGoghsdailylife  Vincent van Gogh, Head of a Fisherman with a Sou'wester (1883)pic.twitter.com/x4dpxwPKxK
At what time of day was Vincent most creative?  #VincentFridayFacts He usually painted during the daytime.  As we know, Vincent enjoyed working outdoors surrounded by nature, and it was easier to distinguish the colours by daylight than by candlelight or gaslight.pic.twitter.com/U80SWTpg6w
e asked a visitor to the museum if they knew who the woman in this painting is. Marco from Italy: ‘I think she’s Van Gogh’s friend. Or perhaps they were more. Back then, it was really common to often go to bars. Artists met there, and also displayed their art, hoping to sell it’pic.twitter.com/BUhEm1WXv0

‘I walk here as much as I can, but I’m very busy. It’s absolutely beautiful here (even though it’s in the city). [..] If one truly loves nature one finds beauty everywhere’, wrote Vincent from London. Where would you most like to take a walk?  #VanGoghsdailylifepic.twitter.com/YW6UAYu04S
Nowadays, we’re used to setting the alarm on our phones.

'What would life be if we didn’t dare to take things in hand?’, wrote Vincent to his brother Theo in 1881. That was the year that he truly set to work as an artist.  #MondayMotivation And we all know how that worked out! #VanGoghsdailylife  Vincent van Gogh, Sunflowerspic.twitter.com/XbaYReyHts
as Van Gogh a foodie?  Vincent didn’t usually take good care of himself when it came to food.  When he was hard at work, he sometimes forgot to eat. In busy periods, Vincent would make do with dry bread and lots of coffee.  In the evening, he often ate out.pic.twitter.com/IomvKh7dOA
‘That day passed like a dream, I had been so immersed … all day that I had literally forgotten even to eat and drink’. Vincent filled his days by painting. But what did he do when he wasn’t painting?  Follow #VanGoghsDailyLife this month to find out!pic.twitter.com/HJF09sGYrR
How come Vincent is now one of the world’s best known artists? After Vincent’s death, his brother Theo wanted nothing more than to raise the profile of his brother’s work. But just six months later, Theo also passed away. His widow, Jo van Gogh-Bonger, completed the task.pic.twitter.com/RCnShexFkw
A sunset from our Van Gogh Inspires Facebook group. ‘Then again a sunset in black, in violet, in fiery red’, wrote Vincent to his brother Theo in 1885. ‘When I saw the sunset, the big shadows of the trees and the play of light, I had to paint it’, says Zurab Dariali.pic.twitter.com/1xi3cgFo8y
e have acquired a pastel by Edgar Degas!Woman Bathing is one of around ten ambitious pastels from a period in which he focused on depicting female nudes.

Fantasy or reality? Paul Gauguin taught Van Gogh to paint from his imagination. Vincent always painted what he saw, but this time he painted a few works from memory. This is one of the works in which he tried the new approach. #VanGoghLearnspic.twitter.com/IhVGcsfiN2
‘Is this painting real?’ asked Georgia from Greece. Of course it is! We asked visitors what they thought of the painting they were looking at. #VanGoghMoves ‘The feelings that Van Gogh expressed are absolutely perfect. I think he tried to express the calmness and the happiness’.pic.twitter.com/vQg3yftNNz
In 1890, art critic Albert Aurier wrote a very positive article about Vincent’s work in the literary magazine Mercure de France. But after Theo submitted Vincent’s paintings to a major exhibition in Paris, where his work was also well received, it all became too much for Vincent.pic.twitter.com/xja7qbF7rv
Vincent’s brother Theo as an artist? Just two years after becoming an artist himself, Vincent wrote to his brother: ‘I wanted to write to you about various reasons why I thought it such a natural thing for you to become a painter’.pic.twitter.com/fkTRu00QRn
‘What I want and set as my goal is damned difficult, and yet I don’t believe I’m aiming too high. I want to make drawings that move some people’ wrote Vincent to his brother. As an artist starting out, he wanted to express a deep, sincere feeling in his work, nothing sentimental.pic.twitter.com/LkpcLlDXAs

Did Van Gogh want to be famous? At first, Vincent thought that being an artist would be a good way to earn money. He realised that he couldn’t count on immediate success. Vincent gradually became more comfortable with his chosen profession, and wanted to move people with his art.pic.twitter.com/ZcXmMG90jT
‘First pain, then joy afterwards’, wrote Vincent to his brother Theo in 1880. It was in the summer of this year that he had decided to become an artist.

#VanGoghContemporaries The first thing that students were allowed to do at art academy was to draw classical statues. So there were lots and lots of drawings of statues in the 19th century! Also by Vincent and his fellow artists. #VanGoghWorks Vincent van Gogh, Torso of Venuspic.twitter.com/hOGxSTlldw
Vincent hugely admired Anton Mauve, a Dutch artist. Aged 28, Vincent took lessons from Mauve – who was also his cousin by marriage – at his studio in The Hague. The work Still Life with Cabbage and Clogs is one of Vincent's first paintings.pic.twitter.com/pK8OXLHPN8
We asked visitors what they thought of the painting they were looking at. We caught up with Simon from The Hague. 'He really had to dig deep to create so much expression with all the different colours. The painting has so many layers, of emotion, expertise and skill’.pic.twitter.com/st0vWdcxXT
‘I am a modern artist’ is what Vincent was saying with this self-portrait. Holding a palette and paintbrushes, positioned behind a canvas. Why modern? He used a new painting style, with bright, almost unmixed colours. View the painting up close: http://vangogh.nl/z9GW50xKAj0 pic.twitter.com/5zJmcs9qRF
#VincentFridayFact Vincent taught himself to draw using the do-it-yourself course developed by French artist Charles Bargue. Van Gogh had three different course books, each containing some 70 prints. He enthusiastically copied the prints.pic.twitter.com/9s9zM2rH6g

He took lessons at the art academy in Antwerp. Before, he had worked alone. It was now the time to learn from others and perhaps even master new techniques. But Vincent thought the other students’ drawings were ‘hopelessly bad — and fundamentally wrong.' He quit the study.pic.twitter.com/4nIOBMlsih

Back to school! #VanGoghLearns Just like many other artists in the 19th century, Van Gogh took lessons at the art academy. Here, he practiced drawing nudes and plaster casts of classical statues. View the complete sketchbook: http://vangogh.nl/Hynu50xKzWB  #VanGoghWorkspic.twitter.com/8X8GDzXqsh
We went to the museum and asked visitors what they thought of the painting they were looking at. We caught up with Tina from Leuven, Belgium. She said: ‘There are a lot of reflections in it because of the light. The painting itself is too dark. It makes me feel depressed’.pic.twitter.com/GOIrQCwlIm

Job satisfaction? It’s clear from Vincent’s letters that he had plenty of this. ‘So then my brush goes between my fingers as if it were a bow on the violin and absolutely for my pleasure’, he wrote in 1888.  Vincent van Gogh, Wheatfield (1888)pic.twitter.com/roaJCJlrbY
Jack of all trades? Before Van Gogh decided to become an artist at the age of 27, he had tried his hand at numerous jobs. He had worked as a clerk at an art dealer, as a teacher, a bookseller and a lay preacher. Why did Vincent eventually decide to follow his artistic calling?pic.twitter.com/SVwms3mzW2

After Vincent’s father died, Vincent had to leave the house. He was behaving poorly. Theo and Wil saw the darker side of Vincent: ‘It is as though there were two people in him, one marvellously gifted, refined and gentle, and the other selfish and unfeeling’.pic.twitter.com/Q4GkVaA1N3
Vincent wasn’t always easy to get along with. His father wasn’t allowed to interfere with Vincent’s life or his art: ‘Pa isn’t the right man to get mixed up in artistic matters. And the less I have to do with Pa in business matters, the better I’ll get along with Pa’.pic.twitter.com/yJShIpVA6Z
incent van Gogh greatly admired the French artist Jean-François Millet. Just like Millet, he wanted to paint peasant life.

Theo van Gogh died less than six months after his brother Vincent passed away. Theo was initially buried in the Dutch town of Bussum, but in 1914, Jo arranged for her late husband to be reburied in Auvers. He was buried next to his brother. #VanGoghEmbracespic.twitter.com/uVWGxIAtdW
Vincent’s parents were heavily disappointed when their eldest son decided to become an artist. They saw it as social failure. ‘Pa cannot empathize or sympathize with me, and I cannot settle in to Pa and Ma’s routine, it’s too constricting for me – it would suffocate me’,pic.twitter.com/sTWbF1GXUX
Vincent and Theo’s brotherly love was profound, as Theo’s wife Jo well knew. On the night that she gave birth to her son, she was worried she might not survive. She wrote to Vincent asking him to tell Theo how happy he had made her, should anything go wrong.pic.twitter.com/f7ydStowq5
The fact we know so much about Vincent is largely down to Theo, who kept all the letters, some 650 of them, that Vincent sent him Sadly his brother rarely did the same, and so most of Theo’s letters date from the final two years of Vincent’s life Read them http://vangogh.nl/G9cp50xvf9Q
‘I feel I have a raison d’être! I know that I could be a quite different man!’ is what Vincent wrote to his brother Theo in 1880, after his job as a lay preacher came to nothing.

Van Gogh enjoyed visiting café-concerts in Paris. These were open-air cafés that held performances. Guests danced and sang along to the pop music of the time. In this drawing, Vincent drew two café-concert musicians, with striking moustaches.pic.twitter.com/YYrfR81MaF
From time to time, Vincent managed to persuade a woman from the street to pose for him, but few models were willing to do so entirely nude. Read more about Vincent’s time in Paris: http://vangogh.nl/2KyR50wWfMf pic.twitter.com/JGY2ALAMIp
Vincent met many artists in the studio of respected artist Fernand Cormon. Artists just starting out often took lessons with a successful painter. But Vincent ultimately learned the most from his artist friends. Read more about Vincent’s time in Paris. http://vangogh.nl/rggd50wWfOh pic.twitter.com/teZ2H2U3V1
Lights up! Play the music! The dancing women in this painting are ‘demi-mondes’, Parisian prostitutes. Jan Sluijters painted them in Paris, where he was enchanted by the nightlife. Sluijters was heavily inspired by Van Gogh’s bright colours and free painting style.pic.twitter.com/E467z9DnTv
Early in the 20th century, it was thought that absinthe could cause hallucinations. In the century before, it was still a popular spirit. Vincent also enjoyed drinking absinthe. Could it have influenced his creativity? http://vangogh.nl/VpnJ50wWflK pic.twitter.com/Ipimy7Z6XD
Both Vincent van Gogh and Jean-François Millet were fascinated by farmers sowing. Why was this subject so appealing to them? Curator of Education Harma van Uffelen explains! Want to know more? Visit our #millet exhibition:  http://vangogh.nl/3PsU50wAwfg pic.twitter.com/uT5BGX3dD3

While women’s rights became an increasingly important topic in social and political debate in the fin de siècle, artists – perhaps as a reaction – often worked with various female stereotypes. Why? Learn more: http://vangogh.nl/N4aY50wWfiV pic.twitter.com/TAcsAHHIHv
The Dutch are known for being very punctual. Arriving late is simply not an option. In Paris, Vincent often saw his friends in the café. Did they meet by chance? Or did they agree to meet beforehand? As a Dutchman in Paris, he will certainly have experienced cultural differences.pic.twitter.com/fdI6DhmHRa
'I’ve tried to express the idea that the café is a place where you can ruin yourself, go mad, commit crimes’. Vincent wanted to show in his painting that the night café was a place where drunkards and other night owls sought refuge. The Night Café (1888) @YaleArtGallerypic.twitter.com/M7A7JivJDY
Van Gogh often drank absinthe, which was a popular drink amongst artists and performers in the 19th century. It was also called ‘the green fairy’.  The drink contained a substance called thujon, present in wormwood, which was supposed to make you hallucinate.pic.twitter.com/QYUn8JhDDU
A singing Van Gogh? Together with his friend, Vincent visited a nightclub where they saw one of Paris’ most famous singers: Aristide Bruant. He sung about the tough life of workers in the French capital. Vincent made a drawing to accompany one of Bruant’s songs: A la Villette.pic.twitter.com/c1Gxq2pjWy
On Sunday afternoon, the residents of Paris headed to Le Moulin de la Gallette to drink, dance and eat. The windmill was on the highest point of the hill, on the outskirts of the city. Van Gogh also liked Montmartre, where he visited and painted the cafés and windmills.pic.twitter.com/F2ZAglgztc
Jean-François Millet keeps inspiring! Not only did Millet inspire painters, but also the dancers of @luciamarthas . Thank you for performing your beautiful choreography in our museum last week.

‘For my part, I still continually have the most impossible and highly unsuitable love affairs from which, as a rule, I emerge only with shame and disgrace’, wrote Vincent to his sister. He was probably referring to Agostina. Read more: http://vangogh.nl/FbfE50wWeWW pic.twitter.com/6IrAnZvOft
Van Gogh often took in the city’s vibrant nightlife. With his Parisian friends Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec, Émile Bernard and Louis Anquetin, he visited nightclubs, where they drank wine, beer or absinthe.

Loie Fuller was the star dancer in fin-de-siècle Paris. She never failed to impress visitors with her spectacular routines. Her long fluttering skirt and multi-coloured lighting effects meant her shape was constantly changing. pic.twitter.com/CBIJHOOOJK
Vincent’s favourite café in Paris was Le Tambourin. Why? He quite fancied the owner: Agostina. Vincent was allowed to exhibit his flower still lifes in the café, in the hope of selling them. Unfortunately the relationship didn’t last. Read why: http://vangogh.nl/vqcD50wWeuI pic.twitter.com/MzrjQJ9pfo
Paris, the City of Light. Van Gogh always wanted to visit. When he was 33, he moved in with his brother Theo. There was a great view of Paris from the apartment, a view that Vincent painted many times. Why did Vincent wanted to go? Read it: http://vangogh.nl/7xRY50wWele pic.twitter.com/N6TYlOClZS
Why did Jean-François Millet’s iconic painting ‘The Gleaners’ inspire so many artists like Van Gogh, Morbelli and Lhermitte? Senior curator Maite van Dijk tells you why! Now on display in our exhibition:  http://vangogh.nl/3PsU50wAwfg  #milletpic.twitter.com/EtrB0i6x6u
'it must be truly good, when one dies, to be conscious of having done a thing or two in truth, knowing that as a result one will continue to live in the memory of at least a few’ Vincent in 1878. He could never have suspected that he would become such a source of inspiration!pic.twitter.com/SBuTKG4MnR

OnThisDay in 1862, our Jo was born!  Jo was not only active in the art and cultural sphere, but also in the Social Democratic Workers’ Party (the predecessor of the Labour Party). And in the developing women’s rights movement, which fought for better working conditions for womenpic.twitter.com/h3xc1sSJtz
Van Gogh in the footsteps of... the artist Daubigny! He was a great source of inspiration for Vincent. When Vincent arrived in the French town of Auvers-sur-Oise, he visited Daubigny’s old house as soon as he could! Just like we now follow in Van Gogh’s footsteps.pic.twitter.com/8tHLph0cSG
Do you recognise the painting above the door? It’s The Angelus by Millet. Salvador Dalí said of this work: ‘This painting produced in me an obscure anguish, so poignant that the memory of those 2 motionless silhouettes pursued me for several years’ #Millet http://vangogh.nl/3PsU50wAwfg pic.twitter.com/5ZRtumnUIu
Vincent sought and found progress in Paris. Inspired by the work of the French Impressionists, he used increasingly brighter colours in his paintings. The dark self-portrait was his first in Paris, the brighter one his last. And there was only a year between the two!pic.twitter.com/FhPJmxq0Sg
It wasn’t only painter Jean-François Millet’s subjects that appealed to other artists, they also admired his use of light-dark contrasts. You can see this in this work by Giovanni Segantini. See these artworks up close in our exhibition: http://vangogh.nl/azV450wAw5V  #Milletpic.twitter.com/Aj8KbAffCV
In this painting by Van Gogh, check out the high horizon and the small strip of sky at the top of the canvas. Vincent paid close attention to the landscapes of Jean-François Millet, who also used this technique in his paintings. #VanGoghRenews #Millet http://vangogh.nl/E8g550wAvRp pic.twitter.com/CyAYMDMp5c
‘And we wouldn’t be able to study Japanese art, it seems to me, without becoming much happier and more cheerful’, wrote Vincent. We also see the inspiration of Japan in this drawing! Vincent van Gogh, La Crau Seen from Montmajour (1888)pic.twitter.com/tAybIkIkn5
The tough country life and misery. As in Millet’s work, these themes take centre stage in the work of Italian artist Morbelli.  The position of the women is similar to in Millet’s painting The Gleaners, which Morbelli probably saw during a visit to Paris. http://vangogh.nl/5nYR50wAw49 pic.twitter.com/R3nIJR8Sby
Which colours would you use if you, like Van Gogh, were to copy this print? In the asylum in Saint-Rémy, Van Gogh hardly ever had the chance to work with models. He came up with the idea of making paintings based on prints of works by Jean-François Millet. http://vangogh.nl/M0Y050wAw1F pic.twitter.com/UVsFGhu6CD
‘A great poet of line and meaning’ is how Emile Bernard described his fellow artist Millet. The bold silhouettes in this painting are inspired by Millet’s work. Bernard enhanced the colour contrast, creating a flat effect. View this artwork up close: http://vangogh.nl/yXi050wAvZr pic.twitter.com/xHvLmXy1lh
Vincent copied black-and-white prints of Millet’s work, in paint on canvas! He made this painting based on a work by Millet he had never actually seen in real life. Vincent only had the copy. See and compare the artworks in the exhibition: http://vangogh.nl/enqR50wAvWp  #Milletpic.twitter.com/aQj5uvvNHj
The similarity between these paintings? Jan Toorop got to know the work of Millet ‘through the eyes of Van Gogh’. The position of this peasant is very similar to Millet’s Vineyard Labourer Resting, but the brushstroke is clearly inspired by Vincent. http://vangogh.nl/xK8I50wAvN0 pic.twitter.com/j6fr1XD1es
When Vincent started out as an artist, he wanted to work for illustrated magazines. He sometimes bought an edition of a magazine especially for one print. He didn’t end up becoming an illustrator, but his collection was a great source of inspiration for his drawings!pic.twitter.com/GfEme6alxi

'Looking is not always seeing'. According to Brooks, we still need artists to show us that the truth is in the detail. Like Van Gogh, Brooks has chosen to focus on the unseen and overlooked. Tomorrow he will explain more about his works in an artist talk. 2 pm! See you there?pic.twitter.com/z4VfydH6Is
All aspects of peasant life. Millet didn’t only paint the tough rural life, but also the downtime after work. This inspired many artists, including Winslow Homer. Visit the exhibition: http://vangogh.nl/2w3m50wAvum pic.twitter.com/WuWkNJcwz3
Van Gogh inspires, to this very day. His choice of subject, brushstroke and sense of style fire the imaginations of many modern and contemporary artists.

‘Think of Barbizon, that’s a wonderful story. They said, I’m no good now, I’m going to renew myself in nature’, wrote Vincent to his brother #OnThisDay in 1883. The painters inspired Vincent to use nature as the main subject in his own work. And to paint it in a new way.pic.twitter.com/Q4QfWFsCzB
Due to his poor mental state, Vincent stayed at the asylum in Saint-Rémy for a year. He tried to rebuild his confidence by copying artworks by other painters. He made his own version of this work by Millet. #Milletpic.twitter.com/KhumLwZzo6

How much did this painting by Millet cost? In 1889 it was auctioned for the highest amount ever paid for an artwork at the time!

‘Millet is - PÈRE Millet, that is, counsellor & guide in everything, for the younger painters’, wrote Vincent. At the beginning of his career, he wanted to become a peasant painter.

The Dutch masters were a great source of inspiration for Van Gogh. When he lived in the Netherlands, he regularly visited the museums in Amsterdam! What would he have thought if someone had told him that, 100 years later, the city would be home to a museum dedicated to his work?pic.twitter.com/Pk1LVAkKuR
Millet’s work was often criticised. His style & choice of subject were unusual in his time. But after his death, the French government embraced Millet as a national hero, who had captured rural France in all its glory.

Do you think this style of painting is traditional or modern? Millet’s style was not traditional. More than that: it was highly modern for his time. The high horizon means that the landscape covers half of the canvas. That was ultra-modern then! http://vangogh.nl/WFw050wAtVJ pic.twitter.com/6tk5BK6zJ9
‘Rembrandt goes so deep into the mysterious that he says things for which there are no words in any language’. Van Gogh had many ‘heroes’ whom he looked up to. Rembrandt was certainly one of them! #VanGoghRenews Isaac and Rebecca, Rembrandt van Rijn @rijksmuseumpic.twitter.com/RJyCdoXKMX

Lots of 19th-century artists painted myths, biblical scenes or battles. But one artist who didn’t was Jean-François Millet. He focused on the tough peasant life. The everyday farmer as a hero: this is why he was viewed as a modern artist in his time! The Gleaners @MuseeOrsaypic.twitter.com/RVyrqIgkPM
Van Gogh mentioned more than 1,100 artworks and at least 800 books and magazine articles in his letters. Why did he read so much? He sought intellectual and artistic nourishment because he wanted to grow, as an artist and as a person. How do you try to grow as a person?pic.twitter.com/jYn5mZ2SC9

‘But anyway, I think I shan’t urge you too much to read such dramatic books when I myself, returning from this reading, am always obliged to go and gaze at a blade of grass, a pine-tree branch, an ear of wheat, to calm myself’, wrote Vincent. Nature brought Vincent peace.pic.twitter.com/m71CZ8PYy5
One of Vincent’s favourite subjects. Large blossoming branches against a blue sky. Almond trees flower early in the spring, making them a symbol of new life. The painting was a gift for his brother Theo and sister-in-law Jo, who had just had a baby son: Vincent Willem.pic.twitter.com/sJms4Pg6Bz
Vincent thought that the Japanese artist was ‘undoubtedly wise and a philosopher and intelligent, he studies a single blade of grass’. Vincent admired this approach and tried to do the same in his own work. http://vangogh.nl/KSaE50vM9UO  Tassel Hyacinth (1889) #VanGoghWanderspic.twitter.com/pxyv5lgItZ
Can you see how Hiroshige III has depicted a bird from below on this woodcut? Van Gogh was inspired by these types of prints, which are called kachōga.

Did Van Gogh make things seem better than they really were? These wild roses may look pleasant and peaceful, but Van Gogh painted them during a difficult period of his life. He was suffering a severe mental crisis, and had admitted himself to the asylum as a voluntary patient.pic.twitter.com/xmPBeYCH6c
Up-close with the corn. Van Gogh often zoomed in on a seemingly unremarkable bit of nature, such as some blades of grass or insects. This resulted in some beautiful paintings and drawings. Do you sometimes spot details in nature? And do you photograph what you see?#VanGoghWanderspic.twitter.com/c4hMeaQKDR
Van Gogh much preferred painting surrounded by nature. When he was at the asylum. Vincent dedicated himself to his work. He probably had very little oil paint and canvas left when he made this: he painted it on cardboard using thinned, leftover paint. #VanGoghWanderspic.twitter.com/BKd4TrED9t
Van Gogh thought that to truly know and understand nature, you needed to work surrounded by it. That’s exactly what he did when he made this painting, during his stay at the asylum. #VanGoghWanders  Vincent Van Gogh, Undergrowth (1889)pic.twitter.com/8ogBx1GYl1
‘Since I’ve been here, the neglected garden planted with tall pines under which grows tall and badly tended grass intermingled with various weeds, has provided me with enough work, and I haven’t yet gone outside’. Vincent van Gogh, Undergrowth (1889) #VanGoghWanderspic.twitter.com/fy8O97Y41C
In between the jumble of trees, we see three women doing the washing. Making a colour woodcut like this was certainly not easy: the artist had to cut a separate wooden block for each colour! Henri Rivière, Wash-place in the Woods at Loguivy from the series Paysages bretons(1894)pic.twitter.com/0flHLoNcGt
Van Gogh wanted to paint the woods in such a way that ‘one can breathe and wander about in it – and smell the woods’. Do you think he succeeded in this painting? #VanGoghWanders http://vangogh.nl/ELGJ50vM8WI  Vincent van Gogh, Path in the Woods (1887)pic.twitter.com/Z9EMjcb4uU
‘Sometimes it’s precisely those spots where one no longer feels anything of what’s known as the civilized world – sometimes it’s precisely those spots that one needs to achieve calm’.

‘a bit of sand, sea and sky, are serious subjects and so difficult, but so beautiful too that it’s well worth the trouble of devoting one’s life to depicting the poetry that’s in them’. wrote Vincent to his brother Theo. #VanGoghWanderspic.twitter.com/6na7rToGlv
The colours of nature made Vincent happy. ‘the Mediterranean has a colour like mackerel, in other words, changing – you don’t always know if it’s green or purple - you don’t always know if it’s blue- because a second later, its changing reflection has taken on a pink or grey hue’pic.twitter.com/c0igNof31J
‘It’s been so beautiful at Scheveningen the last few days. [..] The waves followed each other so quickly that each pushed the other aside, and the collision between these bodies of water produced a sort of foam like drifting sand’ wrote Vincent. http://vangogh.nl/iy0450vM8on pic.twitter.com/1Wj2WlyMpa
The world after Van Gogh? In 1951, photographer Emmy Andriesse travelled to France to follow in Vincent’s footsteps. On this photo you can see the beach at Saintes-Maries-de-la-Mer.

‘I took a walk along the seashore one night, on the deserted beach. It wasn’t cheerful, but not sad either, it was – beautiful’, wrote Vincent to his brother Theo in 1888. Vincent grew up in the countryside, and he held it dear throughout his life. But the sea also moved Vincentpic.twitter.com/Hot4uU23Rk
Van Gogh much preferred painting outdoors, but he painted this work inside. He didn’t have a choice. So he prepared well: on a drawing, he noted the colour he wanted to use for each element in his painting. #VanGoghWanders http://vangogh.nl/Blih50vM8xg pic.twitter.com/IRMHIPq0Sj
Before WhatsApp, there were other ways of keeping in touch. Vincent wrote letters to his brother. Lots of letters! In these letters, he often included detailed, poetic descriptions of his surroundings. Read them: http://vangogh.nl/vDyu50vM8vx  #VanGoghWanderspic.twitter.com/6GZhfavMhm

‘I even work in the wheatfields at midday, in the full heat of the sun, without any shade whatever, and there you are, I revel in it like a cicada’, wrote Vincent to the artist Emile Bernard. Vincent worked hard, also in the hot summer months. He was always inspired by nature.pic.twitter.com/D8LsCTLRuN
‘No matter what people say; we painters work better in the country, everything there speaks more clearly, everything holds firm, everything explains itself’, wrote Vincent to his sister Willemien. Nature reminded him that he was part of something bigger. http://vangogh.nl/z1TK50vM8kR pic.twitter.com/i0mrijXiDQ
Van Gogh was not the only artist to head to the countryside to paint its people and the landscape! One of these other artists was  Camille Pissarro. In this period, Van Gogh also used the Pointillist technique. Influenced by artists including Pissarro. #VanGoghWanderspic.twitter.com/ZJHzTlk2Zc
There are many ways of expressing your emotions. Van Gogh used art to express his. In this painting, he ‘made a point of trying to express sadness, extreme loneliness’.

‘As far as I can judge I’m not mad, strictly speaking. You’ll see that the canvases I’ve done in the intervals are calm and not inferior to other'.

Van Gogh’s shopping list! Vincent was very specific about which paint he wanted to use. He often sent orders for paint like this one to his brother Theo in Paris.

‘I would like to do portraits which would look like apparitions to people a century later’, wrote Vincent. Just like Van Gogh, Jan Sluijters used colour to express personality. For his portrait of art collector Salomon Beffie he chose blue and pink. Jan Sluijters (1912)pic.twitter.com/aru3WWrjan
'Colour expresses something in itself. One can’t do without it; one must make use of it. What looks beautiful, really beautiful — is also right.' Vincent Van Gogh.  Read about his quest, in which his colours changed from dark to bright: http://vangogh.nl/uN3y50vcgXa  #VanGoghColours
Van Gogh believed that artists should bend reality to their will. ‘What Pissarro says is true – the effects colours produce through their harmonies or discords should be boldly exaggerated. […] the right colour is not perhaps the essential element we should look for’.pic.twitter.com/1A2grDOrhH

Why paint more than 40 heads of country people? Van Gogh wanted to experiment with colour contrasts. For this painting, he chose dark tones made from red, yellow and blue. Because Vincent mixed the colours, the contrasts are not very pronounced.pic.twitter.com/C9YkfP6HOj

o welcome Vincent's friend Gauguin to Arles, Vincent decided to make several paintings of large sunflowers in a vase.

ou can see Vincent's search for style in this painting, of which Vincent made two versions. He made the first version spontaneously on location, but took his time with the second painting. Vincent van Gogh, Le parc d’hôpital, á Saint-Rémy, 1889 @MuseumFolkwangpic.twitter.com/smI6I7WMHU
efore he actually started painting, Van Gogh often thoroughly explored different themes and compositions. For the theme of the sower, for example, he made more than 30 drawings and paintings. He admired the French peasant painters Millet and Lhermitte, of whom he owned prints.pic.twitter.com/KNq0O0BHZq
ost 19th-century artists would probably have thought that sunflowers were a little ‘rustic’ and inelegant. But it was precisely this everyday quality that Vincent liked, and he gave the flower the leading role. He even painted sunflowers that had gone to seed, laid on a table.pic.twitter.com/LDZEO59JI5
Just like us, paintings age. Sunflowers will turn 130 this year. Two of the pigments that Van Gogh used in this painting have discoloured. The centre of the flower on the far right was once purple, but is now blue. And the yellow flower heads in the middle were brighter in 1889.pic.twitter.com/c69ocuLBz3
an Gogh wanted to continue improving his work, so he read books. He was particularly interested in colour, and enjoyed reading the theories of Delacroix. The French artist used complementary colours, pairs of colours that intensify each other, to make his paintings more powerfulpic.twitter.com/gY1lpMlKr0
incent was 33 when he first painted sunflowers. It wasn’t in sweeping fields that he saw the flowers, but rather in allotments in the Parisian district of Montmartre.

To Van Gogh, the sower was the definitive prototype of the agricultural worker, who was inextricably linked to the cycle of growth, bloom and decay. The act of sowing brings new life and the sower is at the start of the chain. This symbolism had an almost religious charge for himpic.twitter.com/udKEjTEkGT

In 1890, Van Gogh devoted himself to painting flower still lifes. He said that his paintings needed a month to dry, due to the impasto (thick paint). This is why he couldn’t take them with him when he left the asylum two weeks later. A member of staff sent the paintings on later.pic.twitter.com/65U34GBE1G

Van Gogh took a fast, fleeting approach to painting, which is why you can often track how he set to work. In this picture, he started with the flowers and butterflies, and filled in the background later- the strokes of blue paint occasionally cover the green stems of the flowerspic.twitter.com/XtTJKo8QUK
A pot plant like this is you'd expect to see on a windowsill, not in a Van Gogh painting. And yet he still decided to paint it! Why? The work was a colour study. By setting the orange against a blue background, he created a strong contrast, which makes the colours more intense.pic.twitter.com/zSTWYdHHMW
'today’s palette is definitely colourful. But by intensifying all the colours one again achieves calm and harmony. And something happens like with the Wagner music which, performed by a large orchestra, is no less intimate for that’. Vincent van Gogh, The Pink Peach Tree (1888)pic.twitter.com/FQEH6iznOO
Van Gogh enjoyed working in series. Once he found a subject he liked, he used it for multiple artworks. In Paris, Vincent painted a series of flower still lifes. During his first spring in Arles, he chose orchards as his subject.View them: http://vangogh.nl/xGtF50urIv2  #VanGoghBlossomspic.twitter.com/qReMpspjMJ

He is mainly painting flowers, with the aim of making future pictures brighter in colour’, wrote Vincent’s brother Theo to their mother. The flower still lifes that Van Gogh painted in Paris were first and foremost colour studies. Glass with Yellow Roses (1886) #VanGoghBlossomspic.twitter.com/UTE8VOezFP
he modern art in Paris inspired Vincent to adopt a lighter, brighter and looser painting style. In this work, he also applied a new technique: pointillism. He painted dozens of little dots of unmixed colour next to each other, which appear to blend in front of our eyes.pic.twitter.com/oGGTPWHbnN

n Paris, Vincent flourished as an artist. The colours on the palette are the same as he used to paint his colourful self-portrait. He painted himself in the same way a year earlier. It’s clear to see how his style changed in a short space of time. #VanGoghBlossomspic.twitter.com/JXex6HMYr3
I walk here as much as I can, but I’m very busy. It’s absolutely beautiful here (even though it’s in the city). the chestnut trees are magnificent. If one truly loves nature one finds beauty everywhere’, wrote Vincent from London. #VanGoghBlossomspic.twitter.com/tMPh6fEnfl
the colour they’re painted now is something like the colour of a really dusty potato, unpeeled of course’, wrote Vincent. Van Gogh saw it as his job to depict the harsh reality of peasant life in his art. Do you think he succeeded? The Potato Eaters (1885) #VanGoghBlossomspic.twitter.com/16oZydKRvE

In 1881, Vincent moved back in with his parents in Etten. He fell passionately in love with his niece Kee Vos.  But Kee wanted nothing to do with him.

Finally, a place to call his own! The Yellow House needed to be somewhere where artists felt at home. Vincent got straight to work! He bought beds and chairs, all paid for by Theo. Vincent painted in between times, sometimes working nights on end and even for 12 hours at a time.pic.twitter.com/pqlxZBwZ02
For 25 years, Hockney lived in California, where there are no seasons. Van Gogh probably would have missed the changing nature. The same was true for Hockney: once back in England, he kept returning to the same place to capture the changing of the seasons. #HockneyVanGoghpic.twitter.com/ImBxDyZm5E

Jo, the widow of Vincent’s brother Theo, made it her mission to introduce the world to Vincent’s art. She sold some of his works, loaned some out for exhibitions and published the letters that Vincent and Theo wrote to each other. #internationalwomensdaypic.twitter.com/jwJHcNZ88c
‘I’d almost believe that these canvases will tell you what I can’t say in words, what I consider healthy and fortifying about the countryside’, wrote Vincent in 1890. The overwhelming emotions that Vincent experienced in nature are clearly reflected in his works.  #VanGoghWonderspic.twitter.com/V6P9x4WHxW
David Hockney was a fan of the iPad from the very beginning, particularly of the drawing app ‘Brushes’. He thinks that Van Gogh would also have liked the device: ‘I mean I suppose today, he'd be doing it on an iPad. he’d draw them on an iPad and send them to his brother probably’pic.twitter.com/3roCh4Kza9
‘You can’t be bored of nature, can you?’ David Hockney. Hockney started painting landscapes that were still seen as being ‘old-fashioned’ and ‘boring’ at the time. But as with Vincent van Gogh, nature offered him endless inspiration and never bored him.pic.twitter.com/ZFQLVSOnnD
‘I saw his drawings and was amazed by his graphic touch. Everything is put in there, every bit of grass, every different texture. And through his colour he created space’. David Hockney on Vincent van Gogh. http://www.vangoghmuseum.com/hockney  #HockneyVanGogh Thistles by the Roadside (1888)pic.twitter.com/sQ0sXc3aTL
A close connection with nature, painting with intense colours and viewing the landscape with curiosity: David Hockney and Vincent van Gogh have a lot in common. It’s for good reason that Hockney admires Van Gogh’s work. Find out in #HockneyVanGogh: http://www.vangoghmuseum.com/hockney pic.twitter.com/wWmtIN28Mc

We often only see  the large and most striking things in a painting, and forget to look at  the details. Van Gogh was in fact good at seeing seemingly insignificant  things. Do you look closely at the little details in Van Gogh’s  paintings? @seeityourself #VanGoghCapturespic.twitter.com/Aubyfcy2pl
By working with colour contrasts Van Gogh was able to turn a simple subject into something special. Colour your home with one of our prints of van Gogh’s still lifes. http://vangogh.nl/WRqo30nty1f pic.twitter.com/VplvOwZh84
It’s so beautiful here, if only one has a good and a single eye, without many beams in it’, wrote Vincent to his brother Theo. Van Gogh was able to turn the most simple subjects into something special: even some onions and red cabbages... Vincent van Gogh (1887) #VanGoghCapturespic.twitter.com/KtVdA58XlU
‘My dear sister, I believe that at present we must paint nature’s rich and magnificent aspects; we need good cheer and happiness, hope and love. The uglier, older, meaner, iller, poorer I get, the more I wish to take my revenge by doing brilliant colour well', wrote Vincent.pic.twitter.com/euZMURONkr

Van Gogh deliberately selected the size of his works. In this case, he was inspired by Japanese printmaking. This is reflected in the subject, the bold outlines and the positioning of the tree in the picture plane. Vincent van Gogh, Almond Blossom (1890) #VanGoghCapturespic.twitter.com/1Sf05mV9WY
Vincent made this drawing in the garden of the hospital, which was full of periwinkles. Traces of oil and coloured ink suggest that the drawing lay around in an extra room for some time. Van Gogh was allowed to use this room as a studio. http://vangogh.nl/xkE230neuf7 pic.twitter.com/lvjvh1UsWw
Van Gogh made 20 copies of prints by Millet. He didn’t see these  paintings as simple copies, although he did reproduce the scene meticulously. He saw them as an adaptation of black-and-white prints  into colourful paintings. #VanGoghCapturespic.twitter.com/tzBQ1TBWx1
From Arles, Van Gogh looked out on rolling  fields. The view reminded him of the 17th-century Dutch painter Philip  de Koninck, who was famous for his sweeping, flat landscapes. This is how Van Gogh wanted to capture the landscape near Arles in The Harvest.   #VanGoghCapturespic.twitter.com/Z6tDnSwVaY
Spontaneous or planned? If you look closely at the details, you can see which of these two paintings was created outside. The brushstrokes in Seascape are direct and spontaneous, because Van Gogh was painting in harsh weather. Fishing Boats is a lot more serene and planned.pic.twitter.com/fktZsbtk0p
Van Gogh didn’t paint his many self-portraits out of vanity. He was practicing using different brushstrokes, colours and facial expressions. #VanGoghCaptures Discover more on http://unravel.vangogh.com  #UnravelVanGogh Vincent van Gogh, Self-portrait as a Painter (1888)pic.twitter.com/iqgWMmMh4N

‘He is mainly painting flowers, with the aim of making future pictures brighter in colour’, wrote Theo about Vincent. Every week, acquaintances sent Van Gogh flowers. This was one of the first bouquets that he painted, many more would follow.  http://vangogh.nl/S0hb30netLq pic.twitter.com/x5U0GV8oBf

In 1881, Vincent was training under his cousin by marriage Anton Mauve. In his studio, Vincent produced one of his first oil paintings. In this painting, Vincent was primarily focused on working with colour and improving his brushwork. #VanGoghCapturespic.twitter.com/qckkhIkT4k
An acquaintance of Van Gogh’s in Paris described how he bought old work shoes at a flea market. He then walked through the mud in them until they were filthy. Only then did he feel they were interesting enough to paint. He like their aged look. #VanGoghCaptures Shoes (1886)pic.twitter.com/YOolV7b9PM
Charles-François Daubigny was born #Onthisday in 1817. He was a French painter who mostly painted landscapes. Van Gogh admired his work. When Van Gogh moved to Auvers in  1890, he heard that Daubigny’s widow still lived in the village. He  visited her as soon as he could.pic.twitter.com/bmiAu1bKof
Van Gogh painted the junction in Montmartre (Paris) that he often crossed. The start of the street where he lived with his brother was to the right, just beyond the edge of the picture. #VanGoghCaptures   http://vangogh.nl/83Um30netGk pic.twitter.com/1Akse4nvEE

Vincent headed out with a peasant boy to look for birds’ nests close to the village of Nuenen (NL). They found six, ‘from which the young had already flown, so that one could take them without too many pangs of conscience’. #VanGoghCaptures http://vangogh.nl/6V4s30netUY pic.twitter.com/S2RbhDPBER
'that there are colours that make each other shine, that make a couple, complete each other like man and wife’, wrote Vincent about complementary colours. These colours intensify one another.  #VanGoghCaptures Vincent van Gogh, Grapes (1887) http://vangogh.nl/nERN30neuir pic.twitter.com/cshc3NTjDP
35 flower still lifes! That’s how many Van Gogh painted in the summer of 1886 in Paris. He hoped that paintings with this subject would sell well. Unfortunately, they didn’t. #VanGoghCaptures http://vangogh.nl/83Um30netGk  Vincent van Gogh, Vase with Gladioli and Chinese Asters (1886)pic.twitter.com/kGZHIa0qjk
Vincent often painted his immediate surroundings. In this work, he painted the street where he lived in Arles. He lived and worked in the Yellow House on the corner. The home of his friend, the postman Joseph Roulin, was just beyond the second railway bridge. #VanGoghCapturespic.twitter.com/eQo2jefQNl

Artists often experiment with new styles in their still lifes. In this work, Emile Bernard tried to stylise the flowers and the cup to their essence: lines and sections of colour. #VanGoghCaptures http://vangogh.nl/Lcgh30neuV9  Emile Bernard, Vase with Flowers and Cup (1887-1888)pic.twitter.com/DFg0wYrB14

‘The conscience is a man’s compass, and although the needle deviates sometimes, one must nevertheless do one’s best to set one’s course by it’, wrote Vincent to Theo 1882. Vincent always had big dreams and worked hard to make them a reality. View of the Sea at Scheveningen (1882)pic.twitter.com/jRAFVkdS0K
‘But otherwise — painting and, to my mind, particularly painting peasant life, gives peace of mind, even though one has a lot of scraping along and wretchedness on the outside of life’, wrote Vincent to Theo in 1885. Peasant Woman Digging (1885) #VanGoghreflectspic.twitter.com/IkT8m9ycco
‘It is good to love as much as one can, for therein lies true strength, and he who loves much does much and is capable of much, and that which is done with love is well done’, wrote Vincent to his brother Theo in 1878. #MondayMotivation #VanGoghReflects http://vangogh.nl/8CM430n5ONY pic.twitter.com/iO3R0VZYT8
In early January 1890, Van Gogh reflected on a difficult past year, but still with some optimism: ‘It’s perfectly true that last year the crisis recurred at various times – but then, too, it was precisely by working that the normal state returned little by little’.pic.twitter.com/MS8xI0FrKJ
Vincent to Theo: ‘Well, and notwithstanding, it was in this extreme poverty that I felt my energy return and that I said to myself, in any event I’ll recover from it, I’ll pick up my pencil that I put down in my great discouragement and I’ll get back to drawing’. #VanGoghReflectspic.twitter.com/eNoUk4SEvQ
#Onthisday in 1891, Vincent’s brother Theo died in Utrecht, 6 months after his older brother. The brothers supported each other through thick and thin as they followed their dreams, and often gave each other advice.

‘It is wise to do that, for life is but short and time passes quickly. If one is competent in one thing and understands one thing well, one gains at the same time insight into and knowledge of many other things into the bargain’, wrote Vincent to Theo in 1878. #VanGoghReflectspic.twitter.com/Gk6Mondopz

Vincent to Theo: ‘I, for one, am a man of passions, capable of and liable to do rather foolish things for which I sometimes feel rather sorry’. Vincent knew himself very well. He knew that he could be a difficult man at times, and let his feelings take control. #VanGoghReflectspic.twitter.com/VVJ0a51sSm
Vincent stayed indoors for a long time following his illness. He mostly painted copies of prints by other artists. ‘It’s a study I need, for I want to learn’. Vincent was keen to practice, he thought there should always be room for improvement in his paintings. #VanGoghReflectspic.twitter.com/BBmAeKqEPg
‘He who lives uprightly and experiences true difficulty and disappointment and is nonetheless undefeated by it is worth more than someone who prospers and knows nothing but relative good fortune’. Van Gogh’s ambitions often came to nothing, but he never gave up. #VanGoghReflectspic.twitter.com/HRFKWxuS8n
The landscape around Arles reminded Van Gogh of the world that he knew from his collection of Japanese prints. He used elements of these prints in his paintings. ‘That would really be a Japanese dream, you know’ , he wrote to his brother Theo. Discover http://unravel.vangogh.com pic.twitter.com/6NvnYF9xZP
‘I feel I have a raison d’être! I know that I could be a quite different man!’, wrote Vincent to Theo in 1880. Life was often on Vincent’s mind. What do you often reflect on? Detail of Self-portrait as a Painter (1887-1888) #VanGoghReflects #VanGoghMuseum #Amsterdam #Artpic.twitter.com/U1SVQBSfaS

‘And while my illness was at its worst, I still painted, among other things a reminiscence of Brabant, cottages with mossy roofs and beech hedges on an autumn evening with a stormy sky, the sun setting red in reddish clouds’, wrote Vincent to his mother & sister. #VanGoghReflectspic.twitter.com/n8qCpa6pXA
‘Ah well, I risk my life for my own work and my reason has half foundered in it’, wrote Vincent to Theo in 1890.

‘It’s a study I need, for I want to learn. […] Heaps of people don’t copy. Heaps of others do copy – for me, I set myself to it by chance, and I find that it teaches and above all sometimes consoles', wrote Vincent to his brother Theo. #VanGoghReflects http://vangogh.nl/6t9j30n5OAq pic.twitter.com/TdK3qvuKMG

‘If I weren’t as I am I wouldn’t paint, but being as I am I often work with pleasure, and I see the possibility glimmering through of making paintings in which there’s some youth and freshness’. Vincent had good hope for the future. #MondayMotivation #VanGoghReflectspic.twitter.com/8WWn0REPEP
‘You must in any case go to the museum often’, wrote Vincent to Theo in 1873. Vincent would have seen art like this during his time in Paris. He tried out new styles and adopted what he liked. When did you last visit our museum? Photo @seeityourself #VanGoghReflectspic.twitter.com/x6mpAyU7Cd
There’s a similar reluctance about taking me into the house as there would be about having a large, shaggy dog in the house. He’ll come into the room with wet paws, & then, he’s so shaggy’. Vincent returned to live with his parents in Nuenen 1883, but he no longer felt at home.pic.twitter.com/BLS6q9Cb4J
A year after Vincent cut off his ear, his brother Theo reflected on a difficult year: ‘We must in any case be pleased that you’re much better than you were this time last year. Then I feared that you might not recover’. Vincent van Gogh, Portrait of Theo van Gogh (1887)pic.twitter.com/OSbixf99aY

In response to the excessive amount of French art at the World’s Fair, Gauguin and two artist friends organised their own exhibition at Café Volpini. Gauguin exhibited a series of prints tracing the artistic phases of his career. These two refer to Martinique. #GauguinLavalpic.twitter.com/eTtz6z0lVw
Vincent was full of dreams and ambitions, but he couldn’t make them all reality. He was a passionate artist and wrote to his brother Theo with fiery enthusiasm about his plans. Many of his ambitions came to nothing, but Vincent never gave up. Read more: http://vangogh.nl/F7s930mwUJc
Félix Édouard Vallotton was born #OnThisDay in 1865. While other fin-de-siècle printmakers mostly used the colour lithography technique, Vallotton focused on the expressive power of black ink on white paper. Felix Vallotton, Laziness (La paresse) (1896) #VanGoghBelievespic.twitter.com/KMebHd7WKe
Van Gogh painted this resurrection scene shortly before leaving the hospital to move to Auvers. Could it be that he identified with Lazarus in the tomb? Being able to leave the hospital after such a long time probably felt like a fresh start. The Raising of Lazarus (1890)pic.twitter.com/i1xlrsBPjN
In Auvers, Van Gogh painted ceaselessly. He felt like a broken man and had lost hope of recovery, but he continued to paint right up until the end. ‘The morning before his death, he had painted a sous-bois, full of sun and life’, wrote Andries Bonger. Tree Roots (1890)pic.twitter.com/kpEw2jIY0M
Merry Christmas! Van Gogh admired the painter Jean-François Millet, and used one of his prints as a model for this work. A peasant couple sit by the light of an oil lamp. The child sleeps and the cat dozes next to the fireplace. Evening (after Millet) (1889) #VanGoghBelievespic.twitter.com/tOS1QWeE2o
Christmas Eve is certainly a time for seasonal goodwill. Van Gogh (re)read Dickens’ novels throughout his life. One of his favourites was ‘A Christmas Carol’ (1843), a book that focuses on charity and humanity. How do you like to express seasonal goodwill? #ChristmasEvepic.twitter.com/4UZCEtCZFq
When Vincent became an artist and turned his back on the church, a personal sense of God remained important to him. At the hospital in Saint-Rémy, he copied several religious prints. One of these was Pietà, the Virgin Mary with Christ in her arms. Vincent van Gogh, Pietà (1889)pic.twitter.com/lLxXKGp1P4
‘We rightly came to the conclusion that first of all our goal must be to find a certain position and a profession to which we can devote ourselves entirely’, wrote Vincent to his brother Theo in 1878. Vincent van Gogh, Sunflowers (1889) #VanGoghBelievespic.twitter.com/jAzTs6DfD2
The influence of Martinique could be seen in the work of Gauguin and Laval long after their visit to the island. They had discovered new themes and developed an innovative style. Paul Gauguin, Women on the Banks of the River (1892) #GauguinLavalpic.twitter.com/r2BWEVVAaB
‘No matter what people say; we painters work better in the country, everything there speaks more clearly, everything holds firm, everything explains itself …’, wrote Vincent to Willemien in 1890. Vincent ultimately found his religion in nature. Landscape at Twilight (1890)pic.twitter.com/6E6HT9H8jv
Before Vincent became an artist, religion played an important role in his life. However, soon after his career change, the tide changed: ‘Look, I find the clergymen’s God as dead as a doornail. But does that make me an atheist?’, he asked Theo (1881). #VanGoghBelievespic.twitter.com/cC5iuBzLSi
‘I keep on making what I can’t do yet in order to learn to be able to do it’, wrote Vincent in 1885. What’s your #MondayMotivation today? In the same way that Van Gogh was inspired by other artists, we are today inspired by him. #InspirationalQuote #VanGoghBelievespic.twitter.com/XrPLPiL5Ae
When Van Gogh had found several models to paint in Arles, he praised them for values including love, sympathy and solace; values preached in the Bible’. Vincent van Gogh, An Old Woman of Arles (1888) #VanGoghBelieves http://vangogh.nl/F7s930mwUJc pic.twitter.com/hUVJPUnCEl
‘Theo, woe is me if I don’t preach the gospel, and if I didn’t have my sight fixed on that and didn’t have hope and faith in Christ, then I would only have woe. Now, however, I have a bit of spirit as well’, wrote Vincent to Theo in 1876. Self-portrait (1887) #VanGoghBelievespic.twitter.com/aVlDjV5iXd
The first time that Vincent lived in Paris was in 1875. He devoted himself to copying passages from the Bible. Ten years later he returned, when his life was totally different. He stayed in bars all night with his friends, and painted captivating street scenes. #VanGoghBelievespic.twitter.com/uOHZtq3cvA
Instead of being borne out of doctrine, Vincent thought that belief should be founded in human emotions, and primarily the emotions of people from the lower social classes. In The Potato Eaters, he wanted to depict the harsh reality of country life.pic.twitter.com/zdAKGhefA7
‘…do let’s continue to support each other and to seek brotherly love’, wrote Vincent to his brother Theo in 1877.

Over the years, Vincent became increasingly distanced from the traditional Christian faith. The church and the Bible no longer influenced him. However, religion continued to play a role in his life, as well as in his artworks. He found his religion outside, in nature.pic.twitter.com/QIHWBsNEZ4
Vincent’s father was a minister. He and his wife raised their children to have a strong sense of right and wrong. Vincent’s parents encouraged him to read widely. He read moralistic books that focused on charity and humanity. #Foodforthought The Old Church Tower at Nuenen (1885)pic.twitter.com/YUDgP1f79R
After Vincent’s brother advised him to become an artist, he came to believe that it would also be possible for him to serve God in his new profession. In 1880, he moved to Brussels, in search of the next step in his career as an artist. He drew this work, after an old master.pic.twitter.com/dDfUNzyCe3

It would appear that he lost interest in painting portraits. #VanGoghPortrayspic.twitter.com/006ZUpMD25
‘You’ll say that this is something like, say, the face of — death’, wrote Van Gogh to his sister Willemien about this self-portrait. In Self-Portrait as a Painter (1887), he tried to express how he felt. Paris had exhausted him both mentally and physically. #VanGoghPortrayspic.twitter.com/i8fbyZq00H
Van Gogh wanted to depict his subjects as he ‘felt’ them. Colour was an essential part of this quest. He painted this rough and ready zouave (a French infantryman who wore a brightly-coloured uniform) in loud, almost ugly colours: red, green and orange.The Zouave #VanGoghPortrayspic.twitter.com/aWcB7ZyW6D

What did Vincent van Gogh look like? He painted himself more than 30 times, but he looks slightly different in each portrait. This work by the Australian painter John Peter Russell is probably the most realistic portrait of Van Gogh. John Peter Russell (1886) #VanGoghPortrayspic.twitter.com/lSj5ZS16jH
‘I think I’ll get more good models this winter. The boss of the yard has promised to send me the labourers who come to ask for work. I like to give them half a guilder for an afternoon or morning, because that’s just what I need’, wrote Vincent Digger (1882) #VanGoghPortrayspic.twitter.com/csf843by8v

What was hanging on Van Gogh’s walls? In The Bedroom, we see what was hanging above his bed in Arles: two portraits of friends whom he had got to know in the town; one of the painter Eugene Boch and a portrait of Lieutenant Paul-Eugène Milliet. #VanGoghPortrayspic.twitter.com/jK56cVJMeY
‘You’ve never been closer to Rembrandt, my dear chap, than then’. Vincent was moved by the portrait’s air of self-assurance. #VanGoghPortrays Bernard's Grandmother, Emile Bernard (1887) Read more about Vincent’s friends: http://vangogh.com/zC4Z30lnvHz pic.twitter.com/RHPiXza22x
‘What I’m most passionate about, much more than all the rest in my profession is the portrait, the modern portrait. I seek it by way of colour, and am certainly not alone in seeking it in this way’ Vincent considered the modern portrait to be the most important genre for painterspic.twitter.com/JJHa8G80P5

‘… from the people for the people’, Van Gogh wanted to produce drawings that appealed to the lower classes, and that they could afford. He wanted to offer comfort with his art. At Eternity's Gate, Vincent van Gogh (1882) #VanGoghPortrayspic.twitter.com/vROLckrk3h

‘People say – and I’m quite willing to believe it – that it’s difficult to know oneself – but it’s not easy to paint oneself either’. When he couldn’t find a model, Van Gogh turned to a mirror.  #VanGoghPortrays Self-Portrait with Grey Felt Hat, Vincent van Gogh (1887)pic.twitter.com/uArK0U6w4W
Vincent van Gogh rounded off every day in Paris in the bar, where the ‘absinthes and brandies would follow each other in quick succession’, according to the artist Signac. Van Gogh himself later admitted that he was ‘almost an alcoholic’ by the time he left for Arles.pic.twitter.com/R5oeLRiaxP
In each of his portraits, Van Gogh tried to capture something of the social status and daily life of his model. This man was one of the patients at the psychiatric institution in Saint-Rémy, where Van Gogh spent a year. Portrait of a One-Eyed Man (1889) #VanGoghPortrayspic.twitter.com/DsKTXU54Pj
‘Old chap, I’ve had so much pleasure drawing fishermen’s heads’, wrote Vincent to his brother, ‘with that sou’wester, which had fish scales still stuck to it when I got it’. #VanGoghPortrays http://vangogh.com/Co9N30lnN74  Head of a Fisherman with a Sou'wester (1883)pic.twitter.com/87N9nvl2pv
Van Gogh had deep feelings for this woman, Agostina Segatori. ‘As far as Miss Segatori is concerned, that’s another matter altogether, I still feel affection for her and I hope she still feels some for me’, wrote Vincent. Portrait of Agostina Segatori (1887) #VanGoghPortrayspic.twitter.com/mTAG0x9MJv
Not exactly ‘painted from life’! In any case, the ‘model’ was certainly patient. Van Gogh  painted this work while he was studying at the Royal Academy of Fine  Arts in Antwerp. It shows that he had a good command of anatomy.  #VanGoghPortrayspic.twitter.com/RL9OiwEqMU
'the group of people and their waiting expression struck me, and it took on a larger, deeper meaning for me while I was working on it than in the first moment. It becomes more meaningful, I believe, if one thinks of it as the poor and money’. The Poor and Money (1882)pic.twitter.com/N1JDTMPOtS
Van Gogh painted portraits of many different types of people. Their clothing helps us identify them: a postman and a zouave in their uniforms, and of course plenty of peasant figures in their characteristic clothing.

I’m very pleased with Blok. He reminds me of things from many years ago. I hope he’ll come again some other Sunday morning’.

Did you know that Van Gogh often painted not one, but numerous versions of portraits? There are five versions of his famous portrait of Augustine Roulin (La Berceuse), for example. Augustine Roulin (Rocking a Cradle), Vincent van Gogh (1889) @Stedelijk  #VanGoghPortrayspic.twitter.com/E8n3zTP3EH

Vincent travelled especially from Nuenen to visit the recently-opened Rijksmuseum. His favourite work was a portrait by Rembrandt, The Jewish Bride: ‘what an intimate, what an infinitely sympathetic painting’.

During his time in The Hague, Van Gogh concentrated on drawing figures. He drew people on the street. This sometimes caused quite a commotion; apparently not everyone was happy about being drawn. #VanGoghPortrays 'Old Woman with a Shawl and a Walking Stick'http://vangogh.com/jQeq30lnvT0 pic.twitter.com/5EEnqsZ8BY
Van Gogh wanted his portraits, like The Potato Eaters, to teach the art-loving public something about the lives of ‘regular’ country folk, with their straightforward, uncomplicated tastes. The Potato Eaters, Vincent van Gogh (1885) #VanGoghPortayspic.twitter.com/wxvU8SDJf2
Van Gogh moved back in with his parents in Nuenen, around 1883. Inspired by the rural character of the village, he produced numerous studies of its residents. His many studies ultimately resulted in his 1885 masterpiece, The Potato Eaters. Peasant Woman Digging (1885)pic.twitter.com/So1tRlSb16
In Van Gogh’s time, there were few other artists who used such daring colour schemes. With his bright, intense colours, Vincent set the tone for the modernisation of portrait painting. #VanGoghPortrays The Zouave, Vincent van Gogh (1888) http://vangogh.com/ZCQT30lnvno pic.twitter.com/yY4DziX5Jz
Van Gogh’s European journey came to an end in Auvers-sur-Oise. His work travelled onwards, not only within Europe but all around the world. Where did you last see a painting by Van Gogh? Self-portrait as a Painter, Vincent van Gogh (1887-1888) #VanGoghTravelspic.twitter.com/AdB79BcnWT
Van Gogh’s paintings have often travelled further than their creator. The numerous stickers on the back of the painting Carafe and Dish with Citrus Fruit (1887) reveal that the work has travelled to exhibitions all around the world. #VanGoghTravelspic.twitter.com/zhtWxGrW8v
‘Now I have scarcely a doubt that for you, too, you would like the South enormously. It’s the sun, that has never sufficiently penetrated us northerners’, wrote Vincent van Gogh to his sister Willemien while in Arles in the South of France (1888) #VanGoghTravels The Sower (1888)pic.twitter.com/nPbEX1fPjR

‘You have found your path, old brother, your carriage is already sturdy and strong’, wrote Theo to Vincent.

Vincent talked with Theo about the possibility of moving to Auvers-sur-Oise, an artists’ village not far from Paris. A doctor also lived in the village, who could keep an eye on the mentally unstable Vincent. In May 1890, Vincent made the trip northwards. #VanGoghTravelspic.twitter.com/3C4Dk7H2i2
Claude Monet, one of Van Gogh’s examples, travelled extensively through France, the Netherlands, England and Italy. In 1871, he stayed in Zaandam, where he painted this work. Where would you like to travel? Windmills near Zaandam, Claude Monet (1871) #VanGoghTravelspic.twitter.com/MNpuQHKz5K

Shortly after, he suffered a new episode of his illness. Entrance to a Quarry 1889#VanGoghTravelspic.twitter.com/8Rv8XMv4zf

Van Gogh enjoyed reading books by Pierre Loti, a famous 19th-century French author. Loti wrote stories set in exotic places, such as in Tahiti. The author took Vincent on an imaginary journey to the Pacific island. #VanGoghTravels Self-portrait, Vincent van Gogh (1887)pic.twitter.com/86MbP0BrM6

Van Gogh often liked to go walking when he was in Arles. This is the only painting in which he depicts himself ‘on the move’, with his painting equipment under his arm.

When Gauguin and Van Gogh lived together, they often talked about painting in the tropics. Van Gogh dreamt of travelling to the tropics, but thought he was too old to make the trip. Gauguin ultimately travelled to Tahiti in 1891, where he painted this work.pic.twitter.com/lTzDnTkm1K
Vincent did not always have the money for his train tickets. He sometimes asked his brother to help him with the ‘travelling expenses’.

In 1882, it seemed like Vincent van Gogh would marry Sien. However, he started to have his doubts. For a while, he had been considering travelling to the moors in Drenthe to focus on drawing and painting. He indeed left, without Sien. Sorrow (1882) #VanGoghTravelspic.twitter.com/OJg8Ur3hpx

Vincent decorated his studio with Japanese prints. He initially bought the woodcuts with the idea of selling them on. He saw them as an artistic example. What do you decorate your walls with? Utagawa Kunisada, Bringing Incense to the Bedroom in Vain (1852) #VanGoghCollectspic.twitter.com/QKkmTuO4cB
Vincent and Theo built up an art collection together. Vincent obviously didn’t have much cash to spare, so he traded paintings with his artist friends. He received this painting from Émile Bernard in return for a self-portrait. Bernard’s Grandmother (1887) #VanGoghCollectspic.twitter.com/X0Pc2Hdw3R
When Vincent began as an artist, he wanted to work for the illustrated magazines himself. He sometimes bought an issue simply because it had a picture he wanted. He didn’t become an illustrator in the end, but his collection provided inspiration for example when choosing subjectspic.twitter.com/rsxmaPGWi2
Vincent’s brother Theo bought this painting from Odilon Redon. He paid for it using the money his sisters had given him to cover Vincent’s admission to the psychiatric hospital in Saint-Rémy. #OnThisDay in 1916 the artist past away.

The still life is a kind of self-portrait: we see the pot of coffee and the tobacco he enjoyed so much, the envelope of a letter sent by his brother, an empty absinthe bottle and a book of home remedies. Still Life with a Plate of Onions (1889) collection @krollermullerpic.twitter.com/PLpKkqHADy
In 1874, Van Gogh made a scrapbook which he filled with old master prints. One of his favourites was Millet, of whose prints he later made painted copies. What’s in your scrapbook? #VanGoghCollectspic.twitter.com/PhBflzkynX
ew to our collection: Berthe Morisot! This is the first work by this important Impressionist artist in our collection. Leading art critic Roger Marx described her watercolours as ‘the mosts triumphant watercolours of Impressionism’. #VanGoghCollects En promenade au bois (1876)pic.twitter.com/hoEwPhQ1aQ
New to our collection: Adolphe Appian! The landscape painter regularly exhibited at the Paris Salon, but was best known for his large charcoal drawings, which were already popular in his own time. Fisherman in a Boat along a Riverbank (1867) 25.4 x 46.3 cm #VanGoghCollectspic.twitter.com/0nm9GnDY9q
Vincent often went on solitary walks on the open country around Zundert (NL). He picked things up along the way, such as abandoned birds’ nests. Van Gogh thought that birds were like artists, as their nests were works of art in themselves. Birds’ Nests (1885) #VanGoghCollectspic.twitter.com/b1XuwAOUlN
Vincent worked for an art dealer from the age of 16 to 23. He sold lots of reproductions of works by all sorts of artists. He collected what he found beautiful or important, filling the walls of his room with prints. What do you collect? http://vangogh.com/mF4r30kB7Db  #VanGoghCollectspic.twitter.com/FjWUz99JTT
In Charles Blanc’s book ‘Les artistes de mon temps’, Vincent read: ‘colour can be learnt, just like music’. Van Gogh even took piano lessons in order to better understand the gradation of colour tones, and to harmonise them.  Landscape at Twilight (1890) #VanGoghsColourspic.twitter.com/hQkIXr3iPh
‘[…] the painter of the future is a colourist such as there hasn’t been before’, wrote Van Gogh in 1888. In fact, he turned out to be that painter: a shining example for a new generation of artists painting in colour. The Zouave (1888), Vincent van Gogh  #VanGoghsColourspic.twitter.com/krzbRXXuAk
With his colourful works, Van Gogh hoped to contribute to the modernisation of art. Irises (1890) is a fine example of a powerful, vivid work. Vincent wrote of ‘an effect of terribly disparate complementaries that reinforce each other by their opposition’. #VanGoghsColourspic.twitter.com/UFMcGZUKF4
‘Nothing but ears, blue-green stems, long leaves like ribbons, green and pink by reflection, yellowing ears lightly bordered with pale pink due to the dusty flowering’, wrote Van Gogh to Gauguin. #VanGoghsColours Ears of Wheat, Vincent van Gogh (1890)pic.twitter.com/LjTbPwZNYF
Van Gogh began this drawing in pencil before adding oil paint and watercolour in many different shades of blue. He painted the roofs red, to contrast with the blue. The roofs have since faded to brown. 'Old Vineyard with Peasant Woman' (1890), Vincent van Gogh #VanGoghsColourspic.twitter.com/DBhsTqP7HI
Vincent van Gogh often sent orders for paint to his brother Theo in Paris. He was very specific about which suppliers he wanted to use, in this case Tasset & Lhote on Rue Fontaine. Read more in Vincent’s letter: http://vangogh.com/C9N730jOrSk  #VanGoghsColourspic.twitter.com/gctHBiPRe0
nspired by the Japanese artist Hokusai, Van Gogh started drawing using dots, dashes,hatching &short lines. Nanga, Japanese ink paintings in the Chinese tradition, are also characterised by a wide variety of hatching & lines. Vincent was also inspired by these works #VanGoghJapanpic.twitter.com/2b8oEEbGxG
an Gogh painted this flame nettle as a colour study. He used complementary colours, which reinforce each other: the mainly rusty orange leaves are set against the contrasting blue of the background. http://vangogh.com/ASxW30k8A41  #VanGoghsColours Flame Nettle in a Flowerpot (1886)pic.twitter.com/ZWrSw6sQbU

Vincent: ‘Yesterday I drew a very large, rather rare night moth there which is called the death’s head, its colouration astonishingly distinguished: black, grey, white, shaded, and with glints of carmine or vaguely tending towards olive green; it’s very big’. #VanGoghJapanpic.twitter.com/gjMLZxuht1

Charles Blanc’s book ‘Grammaire des arts du dessin: architecture, sculpture, peinture’ explained the effect of complementary colours: colours that reinforce each other. These colour contrasts are at the heart of Delacroix’s colour theory, which Van Gogh used. #VanGoghsColourspic.twitter.com/ayWYYHKM6X

appy #Fathersday! When he was in his early twenties Vincent van Gogh looked up to his father, Reverend Theodorus van Gogh: “Pa’s spirit is so great and many-sided, and at all events, I hope that something of it will develop in me.” Reminiscence of Brabant Vincent van Gogh (1890)pic.twitter.com/fZCxlTxcuR
Vincent thought that it would be worth making a gold frame for The Potato Eaters: ‘This association with a gold tone at the same time brings brightness to areas where you wouldn’t expect it. The shadows are painted with blue, and the gold colour works with that’. #VanGoghsColourspic.twitter.com/UOl0bKrBoW
‘You’ll understand that the combination of red ochre, of green saddened with grey, of black lines that define the outlines, this gives rise a little to the feeling of anxiety from which some companions in misfortune often suffer, which is called “seeing red”' #VanGoghsColourspic.twitter.com/DM5fCOQJUg
When Van Gogh started to suffer from his illness, he lost the ambition to modernise art following the Japanese example. Vincent admitted himself to the institution in Saint-Rémy, where he painted the surrounding nature in more muted colours. Tree Roots (1890) #VanGoghJapanpic.twitter.com/u5kWSNwUgp
Influenced by the Impressionists and Japanese prints, Vincent started to paint expanses of brightly coloured, almost unmixed paint with bold outlines.

‘COLOUR EXPRESSES SOMETHING IN ITSELF. One can’t do without it; one must make use of it. What looks beautiful, really beautiful — is also right’. Vincent to his brother Theo. The Yellow House (The Street) (1888) #VanGoghsColours #VincentvanGogh #VanGoghMuseum #Amsterdampic.twitter.com/LgyYGHW3my
Van Gogh only took a couple of Japanese prints with him to Arles. He no longer needed them as much, as he now viewed the world around him through ‘Japanese eyes’. While in Arles, he painted the one sun-drenched, vivid landscape after the other. #VanGoghJapanpic.twitter.com/pMdg253NHI
The hundreds of prints in Van Gogh's collection inspired him to look for his own Japan in the South of France. He thought the region was just as delightful as Japan: endless sun, beautiful nature, bright light and pure colours. The Harvest, Vincent van Gogh (1888) #VanGoghJapanpic.twitter.com/M11LjNLpHO
Van Gogh also used synthetic paints and inks that were new to the market. He bought lots of his equipment from his good friend Père Tanguy. Portrait of Père Tanguy, Vincent van Gogh (1887) #VanGoghsColours #VincentvanGogh #VanGoghMuseum #Amsterdampic.twitter.com/4ZGNrPTHpe
Van Gogh was inspired by the crowded street scenes in Japanese prints. The bright colours in these prints also boosted his creativity. Gate in the Paris Ramparts, Vincent van Gogh (1887) & View of the Saruwaka Street by Night, Utagawa Hiroshige (1856) #VanGoghsColourspic.twitter.com/gDND3ugImP

Vincent van Gogh: '‘[...] the Mediterranean has a colour like mackerel, in other words, changing — you don’t always know if it’s green or purple — you don’t always know if it’s blue — because a second later, its changing reflection has taken on a pink or grey hue’.pic.twitter.com/qXVozeeZtx
Van Gogh started experimenting extensively with colour contrasts while in Nuenen. For Head of a Woman (1885), he chose dark tones made from red, yellow and blue. Because Vincent mixed the colours, the contrasts are not very pronounced. #VanGoghsColours http://vangogh.com/GkiN30k8ypr pic.twitter.com/4ewUFFLdAG
While in Holland, Vincent read about complementary color contrasts. Instead of using them unmixed next to each other, he mixed the various colors into ‘muddy colors’. When he saw Delacroix’s much lighter, colorful works in Paris, the possibilities of colour began to sink in.pic.twitter.com/JfHOhCUpyK
‘COLOUR EXPRESSES SOMETHING IN ITSELF’, wrote Vincent. He realised that colours were independent of the other colours on the canvas, due to how they contrasted and harmonised. Such as how yellow and blue reinforce each other in Self-portrait with Straw Hat (1887).pic.twitter.com/6pEGSNukCZ

Vincent pinned this study of grass from the magazine ‘Le Japon Artistic’ to the wall of his room in Saint-Rémy-de-Provence. It inspired him to make drawings of details from nature, including his Tassel Hyacinth (1889) #VanGoghBlossomspic.twitter.com/qMdZPupGFm
Because of the impasto (thick paint), Vincent said the painting needed a month to dry, which is why he couldn’t take it with him when he left the clinic two weeks later. A member of staff there agreed to send it on for him. Irises, Vincent van Gogh (1890) #VanGoghBlossomspic.twitter.com/ptWSm5AyHd

Almond Blossom is known for its unusual composition: the viewer looks up to the flowering branches, which stand out against a blue sky. This approach, which is quite rare in European painting, was also used by the Japanese artist Hokusai. #VanGoghJapan #VanGoghBlossomspic.twitter.com/pp2WNr9CX3

‘But what a subject – eh – that sea of yellow flowers with a line of purple irises, and in the background the neat little town of pretty women.’, Wrote Vincent to his artist friend Bernard. Field with Irises near Arles, Vincent van Gogh (1888) #VanGoghBlossomspic.twitter.com/ifxLPmbpvF

Orchard in Blossom (1889)pic.twitter.com/H7QB4MAH3t
‘I’m painting with the gusto of a Marseillais eating bouillabaisse [Provençal fish soup], which won’t surprise you when it’s a question of painting large sunflowers.’ Gauguin was impressed by the sunflowers, they were ‘completely Vincent’.  #VanGoghBlossoms #MuseumDay #IMD2018pic.twitter.com/2wJT1ZbQPy
While in Arles, Van Gogh painted a drawbridge – something that he was familiar with from the Netherlands. He used distinct diagonals in his composition, inspired by Japanese art. He had seen this method of suggesting depth used in Japanese prints. #VanGoghBlossomspic.twitter.com/BNIqJyzH4i
‘This morning I worked on an orchard of plum trees in blossom – suddenly a tremendous wind began to blow, an effect I’d only ever seen here – and came back again at intervals. In the intervals, sunshine that made all the little white flowers sparkle. It was so beautiful!’pic.twitter.com/rUnbyZ6jcQ
Travelling to Arles, Vincent anxiously gazed out of the window to see ‘“if it was like Japan yet”! Childish, isn’t it?’ He expected to find clean air and joyous colour effects, like in Japan. When he arrived, it had snowed. Snowy Landscape with Arles in the Background (1888)pic.twitter.com/XiicndPcAd
an Gogh found this profusion of sunflowers in ‘the little garden of a bathhouse’ (1888) in Arles. They are overgrown with climbing plants in bloom. Vincent wrote to his brother Theo about the ‘amazing brilliance’ of all these flowers under the blue sky. #VanGoghBlossomspic.twitter.com/iXWtBFTtgS

Whenever Vincent did not have a canvas to hand, he looked for other material to paint on. He used the lid of a packing case from the Kiritsu company to paint his Basket of Hyacinth Bulbs (1887). Van Gogh painted directly onto the somewhat battered wooden surface. #VanGoghBlossomspic.twitter.com/DfBQcvXzMq
Courtesan (1887) was a painted copy after a Japanese print, although Vincent also added elements to the composition. He omitted the horizon in order to emphasize the flatness of the image. Space is suggested solely by ‘stacking’ the visual elements on top of each other.pic.twitter.com/B3RLFvITvP

Copycat? While at the institution in Saint-Rémy, Vincent regained his confidence by copying works by other artists.

incent painted this work for fellow artist Gauguin as part of his attempts to persuade him to come to Arles. Vincent hoped to establish an artists’ colony, inspired by the Japanese example. http://vangogh.com/qDYv30jcca0  #VanGoghJapan Self-portrait (1888) @harvartmuseumspic.twitter.com/mFCfl8SdcE
In the background of Vincent’s Self-Portrait we can see one of his favourite Japanese print. It hung on the wall of his studio in Arles. http://vangogh.com/amDR30jcbTy  #VanGoghJapan Geishas in a Landscape, Anonymous (1870-1880).

‘[…] after some time your vision changes, you see with a more Japanese eye, you feel colour differently’, wrote Vincent to his brother Theo. http://vangogh.com/stKP30iUUNR  Houses in Les Saintes-Maries-de-la-Mer, Vincent van Gogh (1888) Kunsthaus Zurichpic.twitter.com/7fa6UpBLUo
Gauguin was impressed by The Arlésienne (Marie Ginoux) @metmuseum, and Van Gogh wrote: ‘And it gives me enormous pleasure that you say that you liked the portrait of the Arlésienne, based rigorously on your drawing.' http://vangogh.com/stKP30iUUNR  #VanGoghJapanpic.twitter.com/PygIViZk1x
The Hague was also caught up in the craze for everything Japanese. In the years around the opening of his Museum Mesdag in 1887, Hendrik Willem Mesdag collected samurai swords, Satsuma vases and plenty more Japanese art.

‘[..] it makes us return to nature, despite our education and our work in a world of convention’, wrote Vincent to his brother Theo. Discover more #VanGoghJapan: http://vangogh.com/GYRm30jcaXz . Fuji and Cherry Blossom, Katsushika Hokusai (1800-1805), @rijksmuseumpic.twitter.com/k2FpDMXD1H
Gauguin encouraged Vincent to create more abstract depictions of reality. He now more deliberately applied all that he had learned from the Japanese examples in this painting.

In Arles, Van Gogh painted a drawbridge – something that he was familiar with from the Netherlands. He used distinct diagonals in his composition, inspired by Japanese art. He had seen this method of suggesting depth used in Japanese prints. #VanGoghJapan http://vangogh.com/HexK30jcaN3 pic.twitter.com/8WL2J8cEuq
Van Gogh’s ideas about Japan were fuelled by various sources. As was the case with many of his colleagues, he had no plans to travel to the country. He preferred to seek inspiration in the images and texts that he already had access to. http://vangogh.com/stKP30iUUNR  #VanGoghJapanpic.twitter.com/nzflB2Ylsh
Woman Rocking the Cradle (Augustine Roulin) (1889), collection  @artinstitutechi  has been exclusively loaned for #VanGoghJapan! The painting demonstrates Van Gogh’s desire to paint works after the example of Japanese art. http://vangogh.com/stKP30iUUNR pic.twitter.com/vse2isIIot
‘And we wouldn’t be able to study Japanese art, it seems to me, without becoming much happier and more cheerful’, wrote Vincent. Vincent van Gogh’s work changed dramatically under the influence of the exotic, colourful Japanese prints. http://vangogh.com/stKP30iUUNR  #VanGoghJapanpic.twitter.com/ED5HsrAXrH

‘All the colours that Impressionism has made fashionable are unstable’. Vincent underlined the sentence to emphasise the gravity of the matter. ‘all the more reason boldly to use them too raw, time will only soften them too much’. Vincent was right, this was true for The Bedroom.pic.twitter.com/QqUcqaLuKA
Vincent owned an enormous number of Japanese prints. He exchanged them, or gave them away. Our collection is still home to 511 sheets. This means that approximately 149 sheets are missing, either exchanged or given away by Vincent or Theo.  http://vangogh.com/thbL30jca1S  #VanGoghJapanpic.twitter.com/LF1RLMXPpz

To Van Gogh, Japan embodied an unspoilt artistic vision and a love of nature that appeared to perfectly match his own vision.  Vincent van Gogh, La Crau with Peach Trees in Blossom, 1889, The Samuel Courtauld Trust, The Courtauld Gallery. #VanGoghJapan http://vangogh.com/8e7b30jc9yS pic.twitter.com/QaXSo0VffT
Japanese prints of birds and plants inspired Vincent to ‘zoom in’ on details. This was a popular theme in Japan, and probably inspired his still life with a crab. The Japanese example became ‘counsellor and guide in [almost] everything’. #VanGoghJapan http://vangogh.com/stKP30iUUNR pic.twitter.com/3mxUqyDvJE
Van Gogh departed for Arles in 1888 with the idea that the South of France was ‘the equivalent of Japan’. He found the Japanese subjects and colours that he sought in the region. #VanGoghJapan: http://vangogh.com/stKP30iUUNR  Orchard Bordered by Cypresses, Vincent van Gogh @krollermullerpic.twitter.com/q1HFcMgocE
‘Isn’t it almost a new religion that these Japanese teach us, who are so simple and live in nature as if they themselves were flowers? […] It makes us return to nature, despite our education and our work in a world of convention’. #VanGoghJapan: http://vangogh.com/stKP30iUUNR .pic.twitter.com/OBUQWRt66H
oday is Vincent van Gogh's 165th birthday. In "Irises," on view at #ParksandGardens, Van Gogh sought a soft effect by placing the “violet” flowers against a “pink background,” which have since faded owing to his use of fugitive red pigments. https://met.org/2GAp9yx pic.twitter.com/WJo1SO9waB

hat changed in 1900, when trustee Francis Bartlett donated $100,000 (more than $3 million today) for the purchase of Classical antiquities. Over the next 3 years, the MFA acquired nearly 300 works of art, including this sculpture of Aphrodite known as the Bartlett Head. #mfa150pic.twitter.com/wuX6s1h7Fc
n its early years, the MFA's galleries were teeming with plaster reproductions of Classical sculpture. Curators longed to acquire authentic works from ancient Greece and Rome, but funds were limited. #mfa150pic.twitter.com/ATqIRpNsly
igelow donated more than 50,000 works of art to the MFA, including this 13th-century bronze sculpture of Shō Kannon, the Bodhisattva of Compassion (dated 1269). A new wing was added in 1890 to provide exhibition space for these acquisitions. #mfa150pic.twitter.com/QOKWwChIYC
n the 1870s and '80s, inquisitive Bostonians including William Bigelow (pictured farthest on the right) traveled to Japan to explore the nation's history and culture. The quality and volume of the art that they bought and brought back to Boston was remarkable.⁣ #mfa150pic.twitter.com/HssDeJXvhf

In those early years, MFA trustees had little money for the acquisition of art, yet in 1881 they responded to public enthusiasm for antiquities by purchasing this monumental Assyrian relief from the city of Nimrud, in modern-day Iraq. #mfa150pic.twitter.com/Dwpksq1UGY
In 1876, after six years of planning and construction, the MFA opened to the public in its original building in Copley Square. From the start, visitors flocked to see works of art from faraway lands, particularly ancient cities from the Bible. #mfa150pic.twitter.com/GpFdcMaLz6

Brimmer gave this door (14th–15th c., with later additions) to the MFA in 1877, after purchasing it at the Philadelphia Centennial Exhibition in 1876.

ote - Bleaching is a cosmetic treatment; there is nothing “healthful” in this treatment option for the paper support.  In fact, depending on the bleach used, color reversion can occur over time, sometimes discoloring the paper more than it was before having been bleached.
...Add to the considerations, applied media, age of the paper, past storage conditions and exposure history and it may become clear that each work on paper requires individual consideration." —KN #AskAConservator #mfaConservation

The longer answer: Alas, there is no simple, one-size-fits-all answer to this [and many other] paper conservation treatment questions..."https://twitter.com/DonFallati/status/1191395181444182018 … Can paper stains in margins of a print be bleached out?

An opportunistic cat steals food from a frying pan whilst Nicolaes Maes's 'Idle Servant' snoozes in the middle of preparing a meal. Pots and pans litter the floor, but her mistress shrugs her shoulders with a smile that seems to say, ’what am I to do with her?'pic.twitter.com/fGHutiquoc
A cat has made it into the fold of the holy family in 'The Madonna of the Cat' by Federico Barocci. The cat is a relatively unusual motif in representations of the holy family. Here it is poised to pounce on the goldfinch, a traditional symbol of Christ’s Passion.pic.twitter.com/wPndmLvi7C
Domenichino and assistants painted Apollo killing the Cyclops as a trompe l'oeil tapestry with an embroidered border. This is drawn up in the lower right corner to reveal fruit and a plate with leftovers, some of which have been stolen by a cat.pic.twitter.com/1ANSZUSfmf
You can still make out the ghostly outline of the cat in Antonello da Messina's 'Saint Jerome in his Study'. Antonello offers a peek into the saint’s environment through a fictive stone wall pierced by a broad archway, as though we're looking into a doll’s house.pic.twitter.com/whHi5AqXVN
A feline friend plays with a ball of wool in Pintoricchio's 'Penelope with the Suitors'. Penelope was married to the Greek hero Odysseus, who fought in the Trojan war, but during his 20-year absence she was pursued by other men – seen here queuing up for her attention.pic.twitter.com/AQHKsFJVzB
'He who plays with cats gets scratched’, Judith Leyster warns us in this painting of 'A Boy and a Girl with a Cat and an Eel'. In other words, he who looks for trouble will get it; an old Dutch motto that appears to be a possible source for Leyster’s cheerful picture.pic.twitter.com/pRnpk8D1SO
In Hogarth's portrait of the Graham children, a cat startles a goldfinch by menacingly scrambling with its claws up the back of the chair. Hogarth included the goldfinch, a symbol of resurrection, as Thomas, the seemingly lively baby, died before Hogarth worked on the portrait.pic.twitter.com/4Kq4NyN1Rm

Want to know more? You can! Have a read about the paintings that inspired #Bomberg: https://bit.ly/35dotIq  Some of his earliest works are also on display in our free exhibition, 'Young Bomberg and the Old Masters' in Room 1: https://bit.ly/33oF0aK pic.twitter.com/BeMPrat0Xh
In a 1922 lecture, #Bomberg described the painting as 'a picture with powerful pink, powerful purple, but what is most powerful...is the design. No one but El Greco ever did such a thing...El Greco was an inventor'.pic.twitter.com/0rTYUCylcm
While #Bomberg was painting 'Sappers at Work', the Spanish renaissance painter El Greco suddenly became a key influence. In 1919, the Gallery bought 'The Agony in the Garden of Gethseman', and visitors - including Bomberg - were fascinated.pic.twitter.com/XLUdOGkq2N
#Bomberg would have regarded it as a major depiction of men’s bodies. The right leg in Bomberg’s image of the digging sapper, flexed with the strain of intense physical activity, is clearly indebted to its prodigious precedent. See this work in Room 59.pic.twitter.com/mpGgQvlPh3
In #Bomberg’s ‘Sappers’, we see a worker bending over his shovel, surprising the viewer with his green-trousered buttocks and bare legs. Bomberg relates his painting to the powerful figure of an archer in ‘The Martyrdom of Saint Sebastian’ by Antonio and Piero del Pollaiuolo.pic.twitter.com/hluHiWw31I
Their emotive composition suggests inspiration from Botticelli’s ‘Mystic Nativity’, in which the Renaissance master foregrounds the painting with angels ardently embracing men in reconciliation and in solace.  Botticelli's work is on display in Room 58.pic.twitter.com/MzumOUiQiy
#Bomberg’s ‘Vision of Ezekiel’ shows heartfelt moments from a biblical story. Having risen from the dead, figures clasp each other with a profound sense of wonder. Their urge to embrace is defined in kneeling protagonists preparing to stand upright and regain their former life.pic.twitter.com/YwMkJwyWTK
#Bomberg seems influenced by the forceful arm-gesture in Veronese’s 'Unfaithfulness', a dramatic composition in which a female figure is physically held by a child and a man to her left, her other hand joined with that of her lover on the right. Get a closer look in Room 11.pic.twitter.com/LVVOTtMDik
#Bomberg’s carefully constructed painting ‘In the Hold’ shows a man extending his arms across the chaos in an emigrant ship, helping adults and children being unloaded. The painting’s composition stresses the unfolding action of its scene.pic.twitter.com/CFFFatvP9G
'He pointed out to me the wonderful composition of the picture and marvelous proportions of the figures […] David explained that the modern pictures had their beginning with the Old Masters and Michael Angelo [sic] was the chief of these” Do as the Bombergs did & head to Room 8pic.twitter.com/NeGQ4Fy0if
In 1914, #Bomberg took his later wife, Alice Mayes, on a date to the Gallery. She recalls how the artist rushed her through the rooms: “I was to keep my eyes for the picture and so we came to Michael Angelo’s [sic] “Entombment”...pic.twitter.com/Wx9jAdHktm

But he would not have received any income from these portraits as they were not commissioned. (He only ever received one commission which was rejected).  #GauguinPortraitspic.twitter.com/26VE9kSljL
Who were Gauguin's sitters?  He almost always painted people he knew, including the painters Charles Laval, Meijer de Haan and Louis Roy.  Painting friends meant that he was free to experiment with composition and colour, not being bound by a patron’s brief. #GauguinPortraitspic.twitter.com/QKag13v3dY
Why did Gauguin paint himself as Christ?  In ‘Christ in the Garden of Olives’, we know it’s Gauguin; we recognise his hooded eyes and hocked nose. He finds a parallel between Christ’s anguish and his own feelings of being misunderstood. #GauguinPortraitspic.twitter.com/qWeNFGzhgI
Also, the cheapest model for the artist is...of course...himself and Gauguin painted himself repeatedly.  Gauguin became a full-time painter at the age of 35 and this self portrait shows the cramped conditions of his studio in his attic.  #GauguinPortraitspic.twitter.com/2kZ9aKd74h
Gauguin used his self portraits as a way to strengthen relationships, exchanging or giving them to fellow artists and contacts, or to ingratiate himself with new acquaintances.  (This self portrait includes both a dedication to Charles Laval & a rededication to Eugène Carrière)pic.twitter.com/cNuiYVcN7t
Why did Gauguin paint so many self portraits?  Throughout his life, Gauguin was preoccupied by his self-image. His constant reinvention; his self-mythologisation, are all reflected in the self portraits. #GauguinPortraitspic.twitter.com/H7rpH0Cfgh
Why are Gauguin’s portraits so important?  Gauguin gives us something new; he innovates, experimenting with colour, likeness, and composition. His original colours choices, distortion of form, and use of symbols was revolutionary.  #GauguinPortraitspic.twitter.com/wjtc60ypIS
